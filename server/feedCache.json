      "contentSnippet": "Google knows a lot about you and your interests, and it uses that information to try and get more of your time and attention. A new Search Labs experiment called \"Daily Listen,\" for instance, can turn your Discover feed into a professional podcast. Google's Discover is a curated feed on mobile devices filled with articles and videos that the company's algorithms believe are aligned with your interests based on your search queries and other activities. As 9to5Google notes, this feature is similar to the one Google released for NotebookLM last year. That NotebookLM tool can turn materials you feed it into a podcast with two hosts who even banter like they're real people.¬†\nDaily Listen can create a podcast episode around 5 minutes in length that you can listen to for an overview on the latest about the topics you typically follow. You will have to opt into Search Labs if this is something you'd like to try by tapping on the flask icon at the top left of the Google app. Once it's on, you can find the Daily Listen Card underneath the Search bar in the Google app on Android and iOS. Click it to generate a podcast, which brings up a screen with a text transcript and audio controls.¬†\nYou can clearly see where each section of the podcast begins and ends in the audio scrubber, and you can pause, stop, rewind and fast forward it anytime. You can also give it a thumbs up or down to send Google your feedback. If you scroll down, you'll see a bunch of related stories grouped together based on the sections of the podcast in case you're looking for more information.¬†\nThe experimental feature is going live today in the US, according to 9to5Google, though it might take a while to start seeing the option to generate a podcast. It's not clear yet if Google has plans to roll it out to other regions, and there are no guarantees that it will get a wide release.¬†\nGoogle\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai/google-can-automatically-make-a-podcast-based-on-your-discover-feed-131126522.html?src=rss",

      "link": "https://dev.to/mitinoh/crudify-automate-your-mongoose-crud-operations-in-nestjs-455a",
      "contentSnippet": "Are you tired of writing repetitive CRUD logic for your Mongoose models? Meet Crudify, a NestJS library designed to simplify your development workflow by automatically generating RESTful CRUD endpoints. With just a few lines of code, you can set up a fully functional API, complete with Swagger documentation and built-in logging.\n\n\n \n \n üìö What is Crudify?\n\n\nCrudify is a powerful tool for NestJS developers who work with Mongoose. It reduces boilerplate code by automating the creation of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) endpoints for your models. But that‚Äôs not all! It also provides automatic Swagger documentation and integrates a logger to handle uncaught errors, making your API more maintainable and developer-friendly.\n\nWith Crudify, you can:\n\n\nüöÄ Automatically generate CRUD endpoints for your Mongoose models.\nüìñ Get fully functional Swagger UI without any additional setup.\nüõ†Ô∏è Customize endpoints to fit your specific needs.\nüß∞ Simplify debugging with integrated logging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n üõ†Ô∏è Quick Setup\n\n\n\n \n \n 1. Install Dependencies\n\n\n\n\n\nnpm install ncrudify\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n 2. Define Your Model\n\n\n\n\n\nimport { Prop, Schema, SchemaFactory } from '@nestjs/mongoose';\nimport { Document } from 'mongoose';\n\n@Schema()\nexport class User extends Document {\n @Prop({ required: true }) name: string;\n @Prop({ required: true, unique: true }) email: string;\n @Prop() age: number;\n}\n\nexport const UserSchema = SchemaFactory.createForClass(User);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n 3. Create a Service\n\n\n\n\n\nimport { Injectable } from '@nestjs/common';\nimport { Model } from 'mongoose';\nimport { InjectModel } from '@nestjs/mongoose';\nimport { CrudifyService } from 'ncrudify';\n\n@Injectable()\nexport class UserService extends CrudifyService {\n constructor(@InjectModel(User.name) userModel: Model) {\n  super(userModel);\n }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n 4. Build a Controller\n\n\n\n\n\nimport { Controller } from '@nestjs/common';\nimport { UserService } from './user.service';\nimport { Crudify, CrudifyController } from 'ncrudify';\n\n@Crudify({ model: { type: User } })\n@Controller('users')\nexport class UserController extends CrudifyController {\n constructor(public service: UserService) {\n  super(service);\n }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n üåê Swagger Integration\n\n\nCrudify makes it effortless to set up Swagger documentation for your API. Swagger automatically documents all your CRUD endpoints, making it easier to test and share your API with your team or external users. \n\nOnce set up, you can access the Swagger UI at http://localhost:3000/api, where you‚Äôll find a user-friendly interface to interact with your API.\n\n\n \n \n 1. Import CrudifySwaggerModule in AppModule:\n\n\n\n\n\nimport { Module } from '@nestjs/common';\nimport { MongooseModule } from '@nestjs/mongoose';\nimport { CrudifySwaggerModule } from 'ncrudify';\n\n@Module({\n imports: [\n  MongooseModule.forRoot(process.env.MONGODB_URI),\n  CrudifySwaggerModule,\n ],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n 2. Setup Swagger in main.ts:\n\n\n\n\n\nimport { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';\nimport { CrudifySwaggerModule } from 'ncrudify';\n\nasync function bootstrap() {\n const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);\n CrudifySwaggerModule.setupSwagger(app);\n await app.listen(3000);\n}\nbootstrap();\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n üß∞ Integrated Logging\n\n\nCrudify includes a logger to capture and manage uncaught errors, making your debugging process more efficient. The logger is based on Errsole, a tool designed to help developers track runtime errors and improve error handling.\n\n\n \n \n How to Enable the Logger\n\n\n\n \n \n 1. Import CrudifyLoggerModule in AppModule:\n\n\n\n\n\nimport { CrudifyLoggerModule } from 'ncrudify';\n\n@Module({\n imports: [CrudifyLoggerModule],\n})\nexport class AppModule {}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n 2. Access the Logger UI\n\n\nBy default, the Crudify Logger listens on http://localhost:3001. You can access this interface to see all uncaught errors, including stack traces and request details, which makes identifying and fixing issues faster.\n\n\n \n \n Customize the Logger\n\n\nYou can adjust the logger‚Äôs configuration by providing custom options, such as log levels or output destinations, to match your project‚Äôs needs.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n üîé Advanced Query Filters\n\n\nCrudify supports powerful query filters using a simple format:\n\n\n\nfield=[$operator]:value\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Examples\n\n\n\n\nage=[$gt]:30 - Find users older than 30.\n\nname=[$eq]:John - Find users named John.\n\n\n\n \n \n Supported Operators\n\n\n\n\n$eq: Equal to\n\n$ne: Not equal to\n\n$gt: Greater than\n\n$lt: Less than\n\n$gte: Greater than or equal to\n\n$lte: Less than or equal to\n\n$cont: Contains (for strings)\n\n$excl: Does not contain (for strings)\n\n$in: In a set of values\n\n$notin: Not in a set of values\n\n$isnull: Is null\n\n$notnull: Is not null\n\n$between: Between two values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n üí° Boost Your Productivity\n\n\nCrudify is more than just a tool for generating endpoints. It‚Äôs a productivity booster for NestJS developers, helping you focus on what matters: building great applications. By handling the repetitive parts of CRUD operations, Swagger setup, and error logging, Crudify saves you time and effort.\n\nüëâ GitHub: Crudify\n\n‚ù§Ô∏è Support on Buy Me a Coffee.",

      "contentSnippet": "TLDR As part of learning MERN stack, learnt JavaScript, mastered full-stack concepts and built a full-stack web app for Symptom Checker in 6 months. Then tackled the mobile app version of the Symptom Checker, but got overwhelmed by new technologies. Took a break and refocused. Leveraged my existing backend, and used AI tools to accelerate development. Learned the value of strategic planning, efficient tool utilization and a growth mindset.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Overview üëÄ\n\n\nPlanning, building and presenting the full-stack web app for Symptom Checker application in September 2024 was a long journey. \nIt was a 6-month journey of learning JavaScript, starting off with MERN stack and learning the core technologies and concepts from Full Stack Open. \n\nAll of this while building learning projects, updating CV, applying jobs and networking.\n\nRight after, I jumped onto my next project - React Native mobile app development for Symptom Checker application. \nThis rush was induced by the desire to finish the professional courses of the Vocational Degree within 2024.\n\nI started with planning out the requirements for building the app with my current knowledge. \nI was not at my peak performance so I started losing bearings and drifted down the rabbit hole! Here are the wonders I saw :\n\n\n \n \n Challenges üí™\n\n\n\nGot overwhelmed with tools and technologies that would be required to build the React Native mobile app (TypeScript, GraphQL)\n Assumed that I would need a new backend and could probably use Backend-as-a-Service platform (Supabase, Appwrite) for easing this process.\nHowever, learning TypeScript, GraphQL, BaaS SDKs AND building the mobile app prootoype within a month was overwhelming, to say the least!\n\n\nAlthough these tools & technologies were a good list of items to learn as a Software Developer, BUT the project did not need that.\n\n\n \n \n Solutions üîÆ\n\n\nTo come back to my senses from the overwhelming thoughts, I took a week off to reconcile my thoughts and actions.\n\nAfter that little break, everything started to fall in place. I figured that :\n\n\nReact Native components and their implementation were very similar to React. Hence, I could implement the components with JSX for now with thorough JSdocs for future-migration to TypeScript.\nRefer TypeScript documentation to know how\nNode.js Backend that I developed with such dedication by following Layered Architecture and security principles for scalability could also be extended to be used as a Shared Backend for both the Web Client and Mobile Client of Symptom Checker application.\nCheck out Node.js Shared Backend\nFinally, after implementing 1 & 2 from above, I was able to handle the deadline under pressure by :\n\n\n\nlearning key concepts of React Native, React Native Paper, React Navigation from their documentation,\nconfirming key takeaways by using assistance from Claude(3.5 Sonnet),\ngenerating React Native Components by training Pieces Copilot on developed React Components for Symptom Checker web app,\nrefactoring the generated React Native Components for expected functionality,\nadding error handling and edge case handling,\n\n\nThis approach is definetely questionable but consider that I have build the same components in React from scratch. \nNow I am validating and reiterating the generated component structure in React Native for faster development.\nCheck out React Native mobile app development\n\n\n \n \n Key Takeaway üîë\n\n\nNever stress yourself out to reach the summit at one go! Relax and rejuvenate between short-term goals. Mind becomes sharper, Goal becomes clearer :)\n\nThat's all for this post.\nIn the next upcoming posts, I will share about how I approached each challenge as I dived down the rabbit hole!\n\nCheers and have a good one everyone! üçª",

      "contentSnippet": "Illustration by Alex Castro / The Verge\n  \n\n Watch Duty, a nonprofit-run app that tracks wildfires with live maps and alerts, has shot to the top of Apple‚Äôs App Store charts this week as Californian residents look to navigate catastrophic blazes devastating the area.\nThe app launched in 2021 and is now available in 22 states, providing evacuation warnings, real-time text, photo and video updates, and a map interface with flame icons to show regions where fires are blazing. Users can access information on evacuation routes, shelter locations, and firefighting efforts, alongside zooming in on the map view to see the latest updates for precise locations. It‚Äôs a one-stop shop for everything needed during a fire emergency.\nWatch Duty is powered by a team of around 200 volunteers, many of which are retired or active firefighters, dispatchers, or first responders. The app pulls its wildfire information from official government reports, volunteer reporters, and 911 dispatch calls which are then vetted and monitored using radio scanners, wildlife cameras, satellites, and local announcements from law enforcement and fire services.\n\nWatch Duty says that the community-bolstered network allows it to provide more real-time information than fire-tracking services like CalFire and InciWeb which rely on government alerts. The app is used by active firefighters and has become a lifeline for people across the western United States who live in areas deemed to be high-risk fire zones ‚Äî Watch Duty says its active users increased to 7.2 million by December 2024 compared to 1.9 million in 2023.\nCalifornians on social media are encouraging each other to download the app in light of the ongoing LA fires raging across thousands of acres of land fueled by high winds and extremely dry conditions. As of Thursday morning, the LA Times reports that the fires have killed five people and destroyed more than 2,000 buildings, including the homes of celebrities like Paris Hilton, Billy Crystal, Adam Brody, and James Woods. \n\n\n\n\nOver 367,000 California households are currently without power according to PowerOutage, and at least 130,000 LA residents are now under evacuation orders.\n‚ÄúSeconding the Watch Duty app so hard,‚Äù said one Californian on a Threads post encouraging users to download the app. ‚ÄúI live in Butte County, CA, (near where the Camp Fire was in 2018) and Watch Duty has been immeasurably helpful during fires like the Park Fire last summer.‚Äù\n\n\n\n\nWatch Duty‚Äôs vice president of operations Nick Russell says that users are drawn to the app because it‚Äôs more accessible than manually checking several sources and social media updates, and because of its network for vetting and verifying factual information. Conspiracy theories surrounding natural disasters and climate change have become a common occurrence online, with misinformation regarding weather-related events being shared by users across social media platforms.\n‚ÄúOne of the big things for us, our big theme, is quality over quantity. We‚Äôre not in a big hurry to get information that we‚Äôre going to have to go and retract later,‚Äù Russell told NBC News on Wednesday. ‚ÄúAnd so if it takes a few extra minutes to get it out there, that‚Äôs fine, but we want it to be that official info; and because we built a one-way communication platform, we don‚Äôt offer that venue for people to circulate nonsense ... And so it really puts the ball in our court for good information.‚Äù\nRussell also noted that Watch Duty doesn‚Äôt collect or sell user data, instead relying on premium app subscriptions and funding from private donations to stay up and running. The core features of the app that are essential for fire monitoring, safety, and evacuation, are entirely available for free.\n‚ÄúI think it‚Äôs really important in today‚Äôs world, where so many people are trying to profit off disaster, to really understand that that‚Äôs not what Watch Duty is,‚Äù Russell said. ‚ÄúWatch Duty will remain free forever.‚Äù",

      "link": "https://dev.to/mrcaption49/dto-dao-in-software-development-2olf",
      "contentSnippet": "DTO (Data Transfer Object) and DAO (Data Access Object) are key design patterns often used in software development, particularly in Java-based applications. Here's an explanation of each and how they relate:\n\n\n\n\nDTO (Data Transfer Object):\n\nPurpose: DTO is a simple object designed to transfer data between layers or processes in an application.\n\nUse Case: It is often used to encapsulate data in a way that minimizes the number of method calls (by bundling related data) and ensures no unnecessary business logic resides within it.\n\nCharacteristics:\n\nContains fields to store data.\n\nNo business logic or methods except getters and setters.\n\nCan be serialized for network communication or API responses.\n\nExample of DTO:\n\npublic class UserDTO {\n  private String username;\n  private String email;\n\n\n// Constructor\npublic UserDTO(String username, String email) {\n  this.username = username;\n  this.email = email;\n}\n\n// Getters and setters\npublic String getUsername() {\n  return username;\n}\n\npublic void setUsername(String username) {\n  this.username = username;\n}\n\npublic String getEmail() {\n  return email;\n}\n\npublic void setEmail(String email) {\n  this.email = email;\n}\n\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nDAO (Data Access Object):\n\nPurpose: DAO is responsible for interacting with the database. It provides methods to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a data source, abstracting the persistence logic.\n\nUse Case: It separates the database operations from the business logic, adhering to the Single Responsibility Principle.\n\nCharacteristics:\n\nEncapsulates SQL queries or ORM (like Hibernate, JPA) logic.\n\nInterfaces with the database layer.\n\nProvides reusable methods like save(), findById(), delete(), etc.\n\nExample of DAO:\n\nimport java.sql.Connection;\nimport java.sql.PreparedStatement;\nimport java.sql.ResultSet;\n\npublic class UserDAO {\n  private Connection connection;\n\n\npublic UserDAO(Connection connection) {\n  this.connection = connection;\n}\n\npublic UserDTO getUserById(int id) throws Exception {\n  String query = \"SELECT username, email FROM users WHERE id = ?\";\n  PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query);\n  statement.setInt(1, id);\n  ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery();\n\n  if (resultSet.next()) {\n    String username = resultSet.getString(\"username\");\n    String email = resultSet.getString(\"email\");\n    return new UserDTO(username, email);\n  }\n  return null;\n}\n\npublic void saveUser(UserDTO user) throws Exception {\n  String query = \"INSERT INTO users (username, email) VALUES (?, ?)\";\n  PreparedStatement statement = connection.prepareStatement(query);\n  statement.setString(1, user.getUsername());\n  statement.setString(2, user.getEmail());\n  statement.executeUpdate();\n}\n\n\n\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nIntegration:\n\nIn an application, a DAO retrieves data from the database, converts it into DTO objects, and sends these to other layers (like services or controllers).\n\nExample Flow:\n\n\nController Layer: Calls the Service Layer.\nService Layer: Interacts with the DAO to fetch or save data.\nDAO Layer: Fetches data, converts it into DTO, and returns it.\n\n\nCode Example:\n\n// Controller\npublic UserDTO getUserDetails(int id) {\n  return userService.getUserById(id);\n}\n\n// Service\npublic UserDTO getUserById(int id) {\n  return userDAO.getUserById(id);\n}\n\n\n\n\nBenefits:\n\nDTO: Optimizes data transfer and decouples UI or external API responses from internal entities.\n\nDAO: Centralizes database access logic, making it reusable and testable.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a deeper explanation or examples!",

      "link": "https://dev.to/linkbenjamin/the-mortal-enemy-of-done-is-perfect-5dp9",
      "contentSnippet": "Hey pals, welcome back to the Adventures of Blink!\n\nFor today's adventure, I want to explore the concept of Agility.\n\n\n \n \n Wait, Blink, you covered Agile already\n\n\n\n\nYeah, I know. We've talked about the value of agile thinking before. So why revisit?\n\nI ran across a really interesting post over at Pulumi... a story about \"Your Perfect Infrastructure\". As I read the story, it occurred to me that this is a very common pitfall for us as technologists... particularly those of the Architect persuasion, who spend their days in design and don't crack open the code very often anymore.\n\nSimen's story is super short, but immensely powerful... he designed \"the perfect infrastructure\". He future-proofed everything. But then as he worked to get it implemented, he found that his design had actually become his biggest constraint! How does that happen?\n\n\n \n \n It's about Commitment\n\n\n\n\nNot like relationship commitment... like database commitment. A 'commit' step is when you finalize your request and confirm that you want the database to actually do the command.\n\nDesigning a system is a lot like that - at some point in the design process, you'll realize that you have to put in more work to undo something than you would to complete the build... and if you find a major design flaw after this point, it's super painful and expensive to alter the plan.\n\n\n \n \n Applying a little logic\n\n\n\n\nIt stands to reason that if it's going to be expensive and painful to alter your design after committing to it... you should delay that commitment as long as possible. (Ok, on second thought, maybe it is like relationship commitment after all! üôÉ)\n\n\n \n \n The Siren's Call: Why we're so eager to commit\n\n\nWe have a lot of pressure cues that encourage us to commit faster:\n\n\nThe Biz wants you to commit. How much is this project going to cost us? When can we get started? How long will it take? Every question they have for us is answered with a commitment of some type or another. \nIt was built into the Waterfall. Think about it - we have a Scope phase. Then we have a Design phase. Then we start to build. See what we did there? We completed the Design and committed to it before we started Building.\nHumans like commitment. It feels good to be able to check something off your to-do list. We love that dopamine hit we get from marking a task complete and moving on to the next thing. So if we're responsible for designing something... well, there you go. We want to commit!\n\n\n\n \n \n But Blink, if I don't commit nothing gets done\n\n\nIt's a problem - we need a design to follow, but we can't commit to anything until the last possible second? How are we supposed to get anything done?\n\nThe secret is that we aren't avoiding commitment. We're just doing it on a smaller scale. After all, agility is about breaking tasks into smaller bites, and then doing those one at a time. So that's what we're going to do with our design decisions... break them into smaller and smaller decisions, and waiting to decide each of them until they can't wait any longer.\n\nAnd we have to resist the urge to build our perfect infrastructure... lest our endless pursuit of the perfect design get in the way of actually getting it done.",

      "contentSnippet": "Japan‚Äôs National Police Agency (NPA) and the National Center of Incident Readiness and Strategy for Cybersecurity (NISC) have exposed a long-running cyber espionage campaign, ‚ÄúMirrorFace‚Äù (also known as Earth Kasha), allegedly linked to China.\n\n\n\nThe campaign, operational since 2019, has targeted Japanese organizations, businesses, and individuals, primarily to exfiltrate sensitive data related to national security and advanced technologies.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIt has been determined that the MirrorFace attack campaign is an organized cyberattack suspected to be linked to China, with the primary objective of stealing information related to Japan‚Äôs security and advanced technology,‚Äù the agencies said in a statement.\n\n\n\nThe agencies said this was confirmed based on an ‚Äúanalysis of the targets, methods, and attack infrastructure of the attacks.‚Äù\n\n\n\nJapanese industries including aerospace, semiconductor, manufacturing, information and communications, and academics were the victims of this attack.\n\n\n\nOther agencies that are involved in the probe include the Kanto Regional Police Bureau Cyber ‚Äã‚ÄãSpecial Investigation Unit, the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department, and other prefectural police departments.\n\n\n\nThis revelation sends a strong warning to enterprises operating in high-stakes sectors like technology, manufacturing, and defense to bolster their cybersecurity strategies against increasingly sophisticated and targeted threats.\n\n\n\nA widespread campaign with evolving tactics\n\n\n\nIn a detailed briefing and technical reports, Japanese officials described MirrorFace‚Äôs modus operandi, which involved leveraging cutting-edge tools like Microsoft‚Äôs Windows Sandbox and Visual Studio Code‚Äôs development tunnels.\n\n\n\nThe attackers deployed malware, including LODEINFO and ANEL variants, to infiltrate systems, evade detection, and exfiltrate data, the agencies said in a document detailing the exploitation methods.\n\n\n\nWindows Sandbox was exploited to create a virtualized environment where malware could run undetected. Tasks were triggered via scheduled commands, allowing malware to operate within sandboxed environments. Attack traces, including shared folder configurations and encrypted files, were wiped upon shutdown, making forensic investigations challenging‚Äã.\n\n\n\nSimilarly, attackers used Visual Studio Code‚Äôs development tunnels to establish covert connections, bypassing network defenses and remotely controlling compromised systems. Event logs and PowerShell commands in targeted systems provided insights into these breaches, the statement added.\n\n\n\nThe MirrorFace campaign stands out due to its use of spear-phishing, zero-day exploits, and highly covert malware, all meticulously designed to target Japan‚Äôs technological and national security assets. Experts believe these techniques reflect a calculated effort to avoid detection while extracting critical data.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúThe MirrorFace campaign underscores how state-backed groups employ advanced tactics like spear-phishing, zero-day exploits, and sophisticated malware to infiltrate high-tech and national security targets,‚Äù said Arjun Chauhan, Senior Analyst at Everest Group. ‚ÄúThe campaign‚Äôs focus on Japan‚Äôs cutting-edge research and defense sectors highlights the evolving nature of espionage, which is increasingly driven by strategic, economic, and geopolitical interests.‚Äù\n\n\n\nIsraeli cybersecurity firm Cybereason which tracks MirrorFace‚Äôs activities under the name Cockoo Spear says the ‚Äúthreat Actor persists stealthily on their victims‚Äô network for years‚Äù and links it to ‚ÄúChinese-state sponsored cyber espionage group APT10.‚Äù\n\n\n\n‚ÄúCuckoo Spear is related to the APT10 Intrusion Set because of the links made between various incidents from Threat Actors Earth Kasha and MirrorFace including both APT10‚Äôs old arsenal (LODEINFO) and new arsenal,‚Äù Cybereason cited in its threat analysis report.\n\n\n\nEnterprise threat landscape\n\n\n\nMirrorFace‚Äôs modus operandi is characterized by advanced tactics, including spear-phishing, the deployment of malicious payloads like LODEINFO v8.0, and the exploitation of customized localized infrastructure for evasion.\n\n\n\nThe campaign has honed its ability to compromise high-value assets, such as intellectual property in cutting-edge research and proprietary technologies crucial to Japan‚Äôs strategic industries.\n\n\n\nWith Japan being a global hub for innovation, enterprises face heightened risks. Attackers are leveraging sophisticated social engineering techniques to infiltrate corporate networks, potentially threatening intellectual property and the financial bottom line. For multinational enterprises, these incidents are a stark reminder of the need to assess and reinforce cross-border cybersecurity postures.\n\n\n\nBroader Implications for the business sector\n\n\n\nThe MirrorFace campaign poses significant challenges to enterprises dependent on secure supply chains, particularly in sectors like aerospace, automotive, healthcare, and telecommunications. According to an analysis provided in an NPA report, compromised supply chains can introduce hidden vulnerabilities, impacting operations far beyond national borders.\n\n\n\nSmall and medium enterprises (SMEs), often subcontractors in critical supply chains, are particularly vulnerable due to limited resources to invest in advanced cybersecurity frameworks. This highlights the importance of larger enterprises incorporating supply chain risk management as part of their broader security initiatives.\n\n\n\nExperts highlight the importance of proactive cybersecurity measures in safeguarding sensitive organizational assets against threats like MirrorFace.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúJapanese organizations are probably already doing what they must or can,‚Äù said Yugal Joshi, Partner at Everest Group. ‚ÄúSome of these are basics like regular vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, hacker days, etc.‚Äù\n\n\n\nJoshi emphasized that adopting advanced technologies is equally crucial. ‚ÄúFor them to do cyber defense more diligently, they need well-staffed CISO functions and use AI and automation in their operations. In addition, leveraging learning from other parts of the world, which Chinese hackers have targeted, will also help them,‚Äù he noted.\n\n\n\nHe added that employee readiness must remain a top priority, particularly given the sophistication of phishing and social engineering tactics often employed by attackers. ‚ÄúEmployees are the weakest link in cyber defense, and they need to be coached, educated, and constantly trained,‚Äù Joshi said.\n\n\n\nJapan‚Äôs coordinated response\n\n\n\nJapanese authorities have intensified their collaboration with private and public sector entities to prevent the recurrence of such breaches.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúBy publicizing MirrorFace‚Äôs tactics, our goal is to arm enterprises and individuals with the knowledge to thwart similar attacks in the future,‚Äù the NPA said in its advisory. \n\n\n\nBusinesses are urged to implement robust incident response strategies, focusing on endpoint protection, advanced threat detection, and rigorous employee training to counter social engineering tactics. Large enterprises must prioritize collaboration with government cybersecurity bodies to gain actionable threat intelligence and enhance real-time defenses, the advisory added.",

      "contentSnippet": "Today marks 18 years since Apple CEO Steve Jobs unveiled the original iPhone and Apple TV at Macworld Expo 2007.\r\n\r\n\r\nStanding on stage, Jobs introduced the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå as a product that combined three revolutionary functions: \"an iPod with touch controls, a phone, and a breakthrough internet communications device.\" He emphasized that these were not three separate devices, but one, and said, \"Today, Apple is going to reinvent the phone.\"\r\n\r\nThis vision materialized as a device that broke away from industry conventions, featuring a sleek aluminum and plastic body, a 3.5-inch multi-touch display that precluded the need for a physical keyboard, a 2-megapixel camera, and ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå OS‚Äîa mobile operating system that provided unprecedented functionality compared to the feature phones of its time. The ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå consolidated multiple devices into one and laid the groundwork for future innovation.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the ‚ÄåiPhone‚Äå dominated headlines, Apple also formally introduced the ‚ÄåApple TV‚Äå, a product that had initially been previewed as \"iTV\" during a previous event in September 2006. ‚ÄåApple TV‚Äå was presented as a set-top box designed to bring iTunes content to the television. The device allowed users to wirelessly stream movies, TV shows, music, and photos from their Mac or PC directly to their TV. It featured a 40GB hard drive for local content storage and supported 720p HD resolution, offering both HDMI and component video output, and was priced at $299.\r\n\r\nAnother notable announcement was Apple's decision to change its corporate name from \"Apple Computer, Inc.\" to simply \"Apple Inc.\" Jobs said that Apple was no longer just a computer company, signaling its intention to dominate multiple sectors.This article, \"Steve Jobs Announced the iPhone and Apple TV 18 Years Ago Today\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

Grok will also be available as a web app.\r\n\r\nThe Grok app features Grok 2, the latest version of the Grok chatbot.

      "contentSnippet": "Apple could be developing a new app that's designed to help users organize meetings and in-person events, if code discovered in the latest iOS 18.3 beta is anything to go by. \r\n\r\n\r\nReferences in iOS 18.3 beta 2 spotted by 9to5Mac suggest the app is called \"Invites,\" and it will show users a list of people invited to an event and indicate those who have confirmed their attendance. The code also suggests that the app will integrate with iCloud, with a web version on iCloud.com also a possibility.\r\n\r\nThe app apparently taps into Apple's previously unused GroupKit daemon, which handles database models for groups of people. Little else is known about the app ‚Äì it could be standalone, or it could be an integration with existing apps. Whatever it is, the Invites app sounds like it will offer more event-related features than those found in Calendar, which currently manages event invites through a rather simplistic interface.\r\n\r\nThe beta code references reportedly first appeared in one of the iOS 18.2 betas, before being removed from the final release. Now they're back in iOS 18.3 beta 2, but that doesn't guarantee that Apple will release the app. The company could just be experimenting with an idea that is ultimately nixed from iOS 18.3, or Apple could decide to hold it over for a succeeding software update. \r\n\r\nApple seeded the second betas of iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3 to developers on Tuesday for testing purposes. There are no new Apple Intelligence features in the updates, which will likely focus primarily on bugs and small software refinements. Additional Apple Intelligence functionality is coming in later iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 updates.This article, \"Apple Seemingly Working on New 'Invites' App to Manage Events\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "contentSnippet": "Das Botnet Gayfemboy basiert auf der Malware Mirai und zielt auf Industrierouter auf der ganzen Welt.Jaiz Anuar ‚Äì Shutterstock.com\n\n\n\nSecurity-Analysen zufolge verbreitet sich das auf der ber√ºchtigten Mirai-Malware basierende Botnet Gayfemboy derzeit auf der ganzen Welt. Forscher von Chainxin X Lab stellten fest, dass Cyberkriminelle das Botnet seit November 2024 nutzen, um bislang unbekannte Schwachstellen anzugreifen. Zu den bevorzugten Zielen des Botnetzes geh√∂ren Router der Marken Four-Faith und Neterbit oder Smart-Home-Ger√§te.\n\n\n\nIn diesem Zusammenhang berichteten Experten von VulnCheck Ende Dezember vor einer Schwachstelle bei Industrieroutern von Four-Faith (CVE-2024-12856), die in freier Wildbahn ausgenutzt wurde. Die Angreifer nutzten demnach die Standardanmeldeinformationen des Routers aus, um eine Remote Command Injection zu starten.\n\n\n\nDar√ºber hinaus wurde das Botnet f√ºr gezielte Angriffe auf unbekannte Schwachstellen in Neterbit-Routern und Smart-Home-Ger√§ten von Vimar verwendet. Nach Angaben von Chainxin X Lab wird Gayfemboy f√ºr insgesamt 20 Schwachstellen und schwache Telnet-Passw√∂rter eingesetzt. Es verf√ºgt √ºber ein Brute-Force-Modul f√ºr unsichere Telnet-Passw√∂rter, verwendet benutzerdefiniertes UPX-Packing mit eindeutigen Signaturen und implementiert Mirai-basierte Befehlsstrukturen. Dadurch seien die Angreifer in der Lage, Clients zu aktualisieren, Netzwerke zu scannen und DDoS-Attacken durchzuf√ºhren.\n\n\n\nAngriffsziele\n\n\n\nDen Forschern zufolge werden √ºber das Botnet seit seiner Entdeckung im Februar 2024 t√§glich Hunderte von Zielen angegriffen. Die Zahl der t√§glich aktiven Bot-IPs liegt demnach bei 15.000, die meisten davon befinden sich in China, den USA, Russland, der T√ºrkei und dem Iran. Die Angriffsziele sind auf der ganzen Welt verteilt und betreffen verschiedenen Branchen. Die Hauptangriffsziele befinden sich in China, den Vereinigten Staaten, Deutschland, dem Vereinigten K√∂nigreich und Singapur.\n\n\n\nLaut Chainxin X Lab sind die DDoS-Angriffe des Botnet zwar von kurzer Dauer (zwischen 10 und 30 Sekunden), weisen jedoch eine hohe Intensit√§t auf, wobei die Datenrate 100 Gbit/s √ºbersteigt und selbst bei robusten Infrastrukturen zu St√∂rungen f√ºhren kann.\n\n\n\nGef√§hrdete Ger√§te\n\n\n\nDer Analyse zufolge zielen die Angriffe des Botnet auf folgende Ger√§te ab:\n\n\n\n\nASUS-Router (√ºber N-Day-Exploits).\n\n\n\nHuawei-Router (√ºber CVE-2017-17215)\n\n\n\nNeterbit-Router (benutzerdefinierter Exploit)\n\n\n\nLB-Link-Router (√ºber CVE-2023-26801)\n\n\n\nFour-Faith Industrial Routers (√ºber den Zero-Day, der jetzt als CVE-2024-12856 verfolgt wird)\n\n\n\nPZT-Kameras (√ºber¬†¬†CVE-2024-8956 und CVE-2024-8957¬†)\n\n\n\nKguard DVR\n\n\n\nLilin DVR (√ºber Exploits zur Remote-Code-Ausf√ºhrung)\n\n\n\nGenerische DVRs (unter Verwendung von Exploits wie TVT editBlackAndWhiteList RCE)\n\n\n\nVimar-Smart-Home-Ger√§te (vermutlich unter Ausnutzung einer unbekannten Schwachstelle)\n\n\n\nVerschiedene 5G/LTE-Ger√§te (wahrscheinlich aufgrund von Fehlkonfigurationen oder schwachen Anmeldeinformationen)",

      "link": "https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html?src=rss",
      "contentSnippet": "When it comes to gaming, laptops have come a long way. Once seen as the lesser cousin to gaming PCs, today‚Äôs gaming laptops pack a serious punch, offering remarkable power and portability in sleek packages. Whether you‚Äôre exploring open-world RPGs, dominating multiplayer arenas or creating content on the side, modern gaming laptops deliver performance that can rival many desktop rigs, with the added bonus of being able to game wherever you want.One of the biggest advantages of a laptop is its flexibility. You don‚Äôt need to worry about bulky setups or being tethered to one spot. Plus, with features like displays with high refresh rates, powerful GPUs and cutting-edge processors, these machines are more than capable of handling AAA titles, eSports and even VR gaming. Many laptops now come equipped with RGB-lit keyboards, advanced cooling systems and next-gen SSD storage to keep up with your gaming needs, too. We‚Äôve tested a number of the latest gaming laptops to see which are worth your money. \nWhat to look for in a gaming laptop \nPrice¬† \nYour laptop buying journey starts and ends with the amount of money you're willing to spend. No surprise there. The good news: There are plenty of options for gamers of every budget. In particular, we're seeing some great entry-level PC gaming choices under $1,000, like Dell's G15 lineup. A cheap gaming laptop in this price range will definitely feel a bit flimsier than pricier models, and they'll likely skimp on RAM, storage and overall power. But most cheaper laptops should be able to handle the majority of video games running at 1080p at 60 frames per second, which is the bare minimum you'd want from any system. \nThings get interesting when you start looking at the best gaming laptops in the mid-range space, with prices at $1,000 and higher. At that point, you'll start finding PCs like the ASUS Zephyrus ROG G14, one of our favorite gaming notebooks. In general, you can look forward to far better build quality than budget gaming laptops (metal cases!), improved graphics power and enough RAM and storage space to handle the most demanding games. These are the gaming machines we'd recommend for most people, as they'll keep you gaming and working for years before you need to worry about an upgrade. \nIf you're willing to spend around $1,800 or more, you can start considering more premium options like Razer's Blade, which is on-par with some of the best gaming PCs. Expect impeccably polished cases, the fastest hardware on the market, and ridiculously thin designs. The sky's the limit here: Alienware's uber customizable Area 51m is an enormous beast that can cost up to $4,700. Few people need a machine that high-end, but if you're a gamer with extra cash to burn, it may be worth taking a close look at some of these pricier systems. \n\n \n \n \nCPU and GPU \nThe answer to this question used to be relatively simple: Just get an Intel chip with an NVIDIA GPU. But over the last few years AMD has stepped up its game with its Ryzen notebook processors, which are better suited for juggling multiple tasks at once (like streaming to Twitch while blasting fools in Fortnite). Intel responded with its impressive 12th and 13th-gen chips, but it‚Äôs nice to have decent Ryzen AMD alternatives available, especially since they‚Äôre often cheaper than comparable Intel models. \nWhen it comes to video cards, though, AMD is still catching up. Its Radeon RX 6000M GPU has been a fantastic performer in notebooks like ASUS‚Äôs ROG Strix G15, but it lags behind NVIDIA when it comes to newer features like ray tracing. (We‚Äôre still waiting to test AMD‚Äôs new Radeon 7000 series mobile graphics.) At the very least, a Radeon-powered notebook can approach the general gaming performance of the NVIDIA RTX 3070 and 3080 GPUs. \nIf you want to future-proof your purchase, or you‚Äôre just eager to see how much better ray tracing can make your games look, you‚Äôre probably better off with an NVIDIA video card. They‚Äôre in far more systems, and it‚Äôs clear that they have better optimized ray tracing technology. NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs also feature the company‚Äôs DLSS technology, which uses AI to upscale games to higher resolutions. That‚Äôll let you play a game like Destiny 2 in 4K with faster frame rates. That‚Äôs useful if you‚Äôre trying to take advantage of a high refresh rate monitor. \nYou‚Äôll still find plenty of laptops with NVIDIA‚Äôs older RTX 30-series GPUs these days, and they‚Äôll still give you tremendous performance. But to be safe, it‚Äôs probably worth opting for the newer RTX 40-series systems, since they support the newer DLSS 3 technology and offer a wealth of performance upgrades. (If you‚Äôre looking out for the best deals, you can probably find some killer RTX 3070 laptops out there.) The entry-level RTX 4050 is a solid start, but we‚Äôd suggest going for a 4060 or 4070 if you‚Äôre aiming to maximize your framerates on faster screens. The RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 are both incredibly powerful, but they typically make systems far too expensive for most users. \nIt‚Äôs worth noting that NVIDIA‚Äôs mobile graphics cards aren‚Äôt directly comparable to its more powerful desktop hardware. PC makers can also tweak voltages to make gaming performance better in a thinner case. Basically, these laptops may not be desktop replacements ‚Äî don‚Äôt be surprised if you see notebooks that perform very differently, even if they‚Äôre all equipped with the same GPU. \n\n \n \n \nScreen and refresh rate \nScreen size is a good place to start when judging gaming notebooks. In general, 15-inch laptops will be the best balance of immersion and portability, while larger 17-inch models are heftier, but naturally give you more screen real estate. There are some 13-inch gaming notebooks, like the Razer Blade Stealth, but paradoxically you'll often end up paying more for those than slightly larger 15-inch options. We‚Äôre also seeing plenty of 14-inch options, like the Zephyrus G14 and Blade 14, which are generally beefier than 13-inch laptops while still being relatively portable. \nBut these days, there is plenty to consider beyond screen size. For one: refresh rates. Most monitors refresh their screens vertically 60 times per second, or at 60Hz. That's a standard in use since black and white NTSC TVs. But over the past few years, displays have evolved considerably. Now, 120Hz 1080p screens are the bare minimum you'd want in any gaming notebook ‚Äî and there are faster 144Hz, 240Hz and even 360Hz panels. All of this is in the service of one thing: making everything on your display look as smooth as possible. \nFor games, higher refresh rates also help eliminate screen tearing and other artifacts that could get in the way of your frag fest. And for everything else, it just leads to a better viewing experience. Even scrolling a web page on a 120Hz or faster monitor is starkly different from a 60Hz screen. Instead of seeing a jittery wall of text and pictures, everything moves seamlessly, as if you're unwinding a glossy paper magazine. Going beyond 120Hz makes gameplay look even more responsive, which to some players gives them a slight advantage. \n\n \n \n Steve Dent/Engadget \n \n \nNot to make things more complicated, but you should also keep an eye out for NVIDIA's G-SYNC and AMD's FreeSync. They're both adaptive sync technologies that can match your screen's refresh rate with the framerate of your game. That also helps to reduce screen tearing and make gameplay smoother. Consider them nice bonuses on top of one of the best gaming monitors with a high refresh rate; they're not necessary, but they can still offer a slight visual improvement. \nSee Also: \n \n Best Laptops for 2023 \n Best Cheap Windows Laptops \n Best 2-in-1 Laptops for 2023 \n Best Chromebooks \n Best Laptops for College Students \n \nOne more thing: Most of these suggestions are related to LCD screens, not OLEDs. While OLED makes a phenomenal choice for TVs, it's a bit more complicated when it comes to gaming laptops. They're mostly limited to 60Hz, though some models offer 90Hz. Still, you won‚Äôt see the smoothness of a 120Hz or 144Hz screen. OLEDs also typically come as 4K or 3.5K panels ‚Äì you'll need a ton of GPU power to run games natively at that resolution. They look incredible, with the best black levels and contrast on the market, but we think most gamers would be better off with an LCD. \n\n \n \n Devindra Hardawar/Engadget \n \n \nOther things to remember when buying a gaming laptop: \n \n Get at least 16GB of RAM. And if you're planning to do a ton of multitasking while streaming, 32GB is worth considering. \n Storage is still a huge concern. These days, I'd recommend aiming for a 1TB M.2 SSD, which should be enough space to juggle a few large titles like Destiny 2. (If you can afford the jump to a 2TB SSD though, just do it.) Some laptops also have room for standard SATA hard drives, which are far cheaper than M.2's and can hold more data. \n Get your hands on a system before you buy it. I'd recommend snagging the best gaming laptop for you from a retailer with a simple return policy, like Amazon or Best Buy. If you don't like it, you can always ship it back easily. \n Don't forget about accessories! For the best performance, you'll need a good mouse, keyboard and a headset ‚Äî these are some of the best gaming accessories for gaming PCs and laptops. \n \nHow we test gaming laptops \nWe review gaming laptops with the same amount of rigor as we approach traditional notebooks. We test build quality by checking cases for any undesirable flexible spots, as well as the strength of screen hinges during furious typing and Halo Infinite sessions. We benchmark every gaming notebook with PCMark 10, a variety of 3DMark tests, Cinebench and Geekbench. We also use NVIDIA‚Äôs Frameview app to measure the average framerates in Cyberpunk 2077, Halo Infinite and other titles. For media creation, we transcode a 4K movie clip into 1080p using Handbrake‚Äôs CPU and GPU encoding options. \nDisplays are tested under indoor and outdoor lighting with productivity apps, video playback and gameplay. We also try to stress the full refresh rate of every gaming notebook‚Äôs screen by benchmarking Halo Infinite, Overwatch 2 and other titles. Laptop speakers are judged by how well they can play back music, movies and the occasional game session with detail and clarity, and without any obvious distortion. \nWhen it comes to battery life, we see how long gaming systems last with a mixture of real-world productivity apps and gameplay, and we also test with PCMark 10‚Äôs ‚ÄúModern office‚Äù battery test. In addition, we‚Äôre judging the quality of a machine‚Äôs keyboard with typing tests as well as relative accuracy and comfort during extended gaming sessions. \nBest gaming laptops for 2025 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nOther gaming laptops we‚Äôve tested \nFramework Laptop 16 \nWe were eager to test the Framework Laptop 16 since it promised both modular customizability and a decent amount of gaming power. But while we appreciated just how repairable and upgradeable it is, its actual gaming performance was middling for its high price. You could always buy it without the additional GPU, but that makes it more of a daily workhorse than a gaming system. \nMSI Stealth Studio 14 \nOn a brighter note, we were pleased to see MSI return to form with the Stealth Studio 14, which is far faster and more attractive than the previous model. \nRazer Blade 16 and 18 \nWe were amazed to see a genuine 4K/1080p native screen in the Razer Blade 16, but it‚Äôs far too expensive and impractical, even for such a pricey brand. Similarly, we found the Razer Blade 18 to be both oversized and overpriced.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html?src=rss",

We tested out more than 15 highly rated docking stations and considered monitor support, number and type of ports, design and price to help you determine which one is the best docking station for your home or office setup. \nTable of contents \n \n Best docking stations \n What to look for in a docking station \n How we tested docking stations \n Other laptop docking stations we tested \n Docking station FAQs \n \nBest docking stations \n\n \nBack to top \n\n \nBack to top \n\n \nBack to top \n\n \nBack to top \nWhat to look for in a docking station \nFirst and foremost, consider what you need to plug in. This will likely be the deciding factor when you go to actually buy a docking station. Do you need three screens for an expanded work view? A quick way to upload photos from an SD card? Are you looking to plug in a webcam, mic and streaming light, while simultaneously taking advantage of faster Ethernet connections? Are you hooking up a gaming laptop to multiple displays and peripherals? Once you‚Äôve settled on the type of ports you need, you may also want to consider the generation of those ports as well; even ports with the same shape can have different capabilities. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of the connectivity different docking stations offer. \nMonitor ports \nExternal monitors typically need one of three ports to connect to a PC: HDMI, DisplayPort or USB-C. HDMI connections are more common than DisplayPort and the cables and devices that use them are sometimes more affordable. The most popular version of the DisplayPort interface (v1.4) can handle higher resolutions and refresh rates than the most common HDMI version (2.0). All of the display docking stations with HDMI ports that we recommend here use version 2.0, which can handle 4K resolution at 60Hz or 1080p up to 240Hz. The DisplayPort-enabled docks support either version 1.2, which allows for 4K resolution at 60Hz, or version 1.4, which can handle 8K at 60Hz or 4K at 120Hz. \nYou can also use your dock‚Äôs downstream (non-host) Thunderbolt ports to hook up your monitors. If your external display has a USB-C socket, you can connect directly. If you have an HDMI display or DisplayPort-only monitor, you can use an adapter or a conversion cable. \nOf course, the number of monitors you can connect and the resolutions/rates they‚Äôll achieve depend on both your computer‚Äôs GPU and your monitors ‚Äî and the more monitors you plug in can bring down those numbers as well. Be sure to also use cables that support the bandwidth you‚Äôre hoping for. MacOS users should keep in mind that MacBooks with the standard M1 or M2 chips support just one external monitor natively and require DisplayLink hardware and software to support two external displays. MacBooks with M1 Pro, M2 Pro or M2 Max chips can run multiple monitors from a single port. \nUSB ports \nMost docking stations offer a few USB Type-A ports, which are great for peripherals like wired mice and keyboards, bus-powered ring lights and flash drives. For faster data transfer speeds to your flash drive, go for USB-A sockets labeled 3.1 or 3.2 ‚Äî or better yet, use a USB-C Thunderbolt port. \nType-C USB ports come in many different flavors. The Thunderbolt 3, 4 and USB4 protocols are newer, more capable specifications that support power delivery of up to 100W, multiple 4K displays and data transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps. Other USB-C ports come in a range of versions, with some supporting video, data and power and some only able to manage data and power. Transfer rates and wattages can vary from port to port, but most docks list the wattage or GB/s on either the dock itself or on the product page. And again, achieving the fastest speeds will depend on factors like the cables you use and the devices you‚Äôre transferring data to. \nNearly every dock available today is a USB-C docking station, connecting to a computer via USB-C, often Thunderbolt, and those host ports are nearly always labeled with a laptop icon. They also allow power delivery to your laptop: available wattage varies, but most docks are rated between 85 and 100 watts. That should be enough to keep most computers powered ‚Äî and it also means you won‚Äôt have to take up an extra laptop connector for charging. \nOther ports \nNone of our currently recommended laptops include an Ethernet jack; a docking station is a great way to get that connection back. We all know objectively that wired internet is faster than Wi-Fi, but it might take running a basic speed comparison test to really get it on a gut level. For reference, on Wi-Fi I get about a 45 megabit-per-second download speed. Over Ethernet, it‚Äôs 925 Mbps. If you pay for a high-speed plan, but only ever connect wirelessly, you‚Äôre probably leaving a lot of bandwidth on the table. Every docking station I tested includes an Ethernet port, and it could be the connector you end up getting the most use out of. \nJust two of our favorite laptops have SD card readers, and if you need a quick way to upload files from cameras or audio recorders, you may want to get a dock with one of those slots. Of the docks we tested, about half had SD readers. For now, most (but not all) laptops still include a 3.5mm audio jack, but if you prefer wired headphones and want a more accessible place to plug them in, many docking stations will provide. \nWhen you‚Äôre counting up the ports for your new dock, remember that most companies include the host port (the one that connects to your computer) in the total number. So if you‚Äôre looking for a dock with three Thunderbolt connections, be sure to check whether one of them will be used to plug in your laptop. \n\n \n \n \nDesign \nMost docking stations have either a lay-flat or upright design. Most docks put the more ‚Äúpermanent‚Äù connections in back ‚Äî such as Ethernet, DC power, monitor connections and a few USBs. Up-front USB ports can be used for flash drive transfers, or even acting as a charger for your phone (just make sure the port can deliver the power you need). USBs in the rear are best for keyboards, mice, webcams and other things you‚Äôre likely to always use. Some docks position the host port up front, which might make it easier to plug in your laptop when you return to your desk, but a host port in back may look neater overall. \nBack to top \nHow we tested docking stations \nWe started out by looking at online reviews, spec sheets from various brands and docking stations that our fellow tech sites have covered. We considered brands we‚Äôve tested before and have liked, and weeded out anything that didn‚Äôt have what we consider a modern suite of connections (such as a dock with no downstream USB-C ports). We narrowed it down to 12 contenders and I tested each dock in a home office, using an M1 MacBook Pro, a Dell XPS 13 Plus and an Acer Chromebook Spin 514. \nI plugged in and evaluated the quality of the connections for 12 different peripherals including a 4K and an HD monitor, a 4K and an HD webcam, plus USB devices like a mouse, keyboard, streaming light and mic. I plugged in wired earbuds, and transferred data to a USB-C flash drive and an external SSD. I ran basic speed tests on the Ethernet connections as well as the file transfers. I judged how easy the docks were to use as well as the various design factors I described earlier. I made spreadsheets and had enough wires snaking around my work area that my cat stayed off my desk for three weeks (a new record). \nAs new docking stations come out and we find models worthy of testing, (there are a couple from Ugreen we have our eye on), we'll update this guide accordingly. \nBack to top \nOther laptop docking stations we tested \nPlugable TBT4-UDZ \nWhen I pulled the Plugable TBT4-UDZ Thunderbolt 4 out of the box, I was convinced it would make the cut: It has a practical upright design, an attractive metal finish, and the host connection is TB4. While there are plenty of USB-A and monitor ports, there‚Äôs just one downstream USB-C. A modern dock, particularly one that costs $300, should let you run, say, a USB-C cam and mic at the same time. Otherwise, it‚Äôs pretty limiting. \nAnker 575 USB-C \nAt $250 (and more often $235), the Anker 575 USB-C could make for a good budget pick for Windows. It performed well with the Dell XPS 13 Plus, but had trouble with the third screen, the 4K webcam and headphone jack when connected to the MacBook Pro. It‚Äôs quite compact, which means it can get wobbly when a bunch of cables are plugged in, but it has a good selection of ports and was able to handle my basic setup well. \nBelkin Connect Pro Thunderbolt 4 \nBelkin‚Äôs Connect Pro Thunderbolt 4 Dock is a contender for a Thunderbolt 4 alternative. It has nearly the same ports as the AD2010 (minus the microSD slot) and an attractive rounded design ‚Äî but it‚Äôs $90 more, so I‚Äôd only recommend getting it if you find it on sale. \nAcer USB Type-C Dock \nAcer‚Äôs USB Type-C Dock D501 costs $10 more than our Kensington pick for Chromebooks, but it performs similarly and is worth a mention. It has nearly the same ports (including the rather limiting single downstream USB-C) but both the Ethernet and data transfer speeds were faster. \nBack to top \nDocking station FAQs \nAre docking stations worth it? \nDocking stations are worth it if you have more accessories to plug in than your laptop permits. Say you have a USB-C camera and mic, plus a USB-A mouse, keyboard and streaming light; very few modern laptops have enough connections to support all of that at once. A docking station can make that setup feasible while also giving you extra ports like a gigabit Ethernet connection, and supplying power to your laptop. However, if you just need a few extra USB sockets, you might be better off going with a hub, as those tend to be cheaper. \nHow much does a laptop dock cost? \nLaptop docking stations tend to be bigger and more expensive than simple USB-A or USB-C hubs, thanks to the wider array of connections. You can find them as low as $50 and they can get as expensive as $450. A reasonable price for a dock with a good selection of ports from a reputable brand will average around $200. \nHow do I set up my laptop dock? \nMost docking stations are plug and play. First, connect the DC power cable to the dock and a wall outlet. Then look for the ‚Äúhost‚Äù or upstream port on the dock ‚Äî it‚Äôs almost always a USB-C/Thunderbolt port and often branded with an icon of a laptop. Use the provided cable to connect to your computer. After that, you can connect your peripherals to the dock and they should be ready to use with your laptop. A few docking stations, particularly those that handle more complex monitor setups, require a driver. The instructions that come with your dock will point you to a website where you can download that companion software. \nDoes a laptop charge on a docking station? \nNearly all docking stations allow you to charge your laptop through the host connection (the cable running from the dock to your computer). That capability, plus the higher number of ports is what separates a docking station from a hub. Docks can pass on between 65W and 100W of power to laptops, and nearly all include a DC adapter. \nAre all docking stations compatible with all laptops? \nNo, not all docking stations are compatible with every laptop. In our tests, the Chromebook had the biggest compatibility issues, the Dell PC had the least, and the MacBook fell somewhere in between. All docks will list which brands and models they work with on the online product page ‚Äî be sure to also check the generation of your laptop as some docks can‚Äôt support certain chips. \nWhat are some popular docking station brands? \nKensington, Anker, Pluggable and Belkin are reputable and well-known brands making docking stations for all laptops. Lenovo, Dell and HP all make docks that will work with their own computers as well as other brands.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-docking-station-160041863.html?src=rss",

      "link": "https://www.csoonline.com/article/3622920/soar-buyers-guide-11-security-orchestration-automation-and-response-products-and-how-to-choose.html",
      "contentSnippet": "Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) has undergone a major transformation in the past few years. Features in each of the words in its description that were once exclusive to SOAR have bled into other tools. For example, responses can be found now in endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools. Orchestration is now a joint effort with security information and event management (SIEM) tools. \n\n\n\nMany of these features are now found in managed security products that go by other names, such as threat and incident response or cloud security posture management (CSPM). And many of the SOAR tools are no longer just focused on security but have expanded to cover the wider context of how an enterprise infrastructure operates.\n\n\n\n[ Download our editors‚Äô PDF security orchestration, automation, and remediation (SOAR) tools buyer‚Äôs guide today! ]\n\n\n\nIn this buyer‚Äôs guide\n\n\n\n\nSOAR defined\n\n\n\nWhy you might need SOAR\n\n\n\nTrends in the SOAR market\n\n\n\nKey SOAR features to look for\n\n\n\nThe major SOAR providers and their offerings\n\n\n\nWhat about the price of SOAR?\n\n\n\nQuestions to ask your team and your SOAR vendor\n\n\n\nEssential reading\n\n\n\n\nWhat is SOAR\n\n\n\nThe SOAR category originated back in 2015 ‚Äî the term created by Gartner ‚Äî when virtualization and containers were first coming into enterprise networks and applications, greatly expanding the threat and attack surface areas.\n\n\n\nSOAR helps to orchestrate and integrate a wide tool collection using automation to perform repetitive and simple tasks, and to produce predefined playbooks that IT staff can use to reduce their risk profiles and response to attacks by bad actors. The category has seen major changes, with numerous acquisitions as the major vendors such as Checkpoint, Cisco, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Palo Alto Networks have bulked up their platforms with SOAR-like features.\n\n\n\nSome analysts have soured on SOAR as it has undergone this transformation and as its features can now be found in other products. Ironically, Gartner has said that SOAR tools have not kept pace with changing requirements, putting them at the very bottom of their ‚Äúhype cycle‚Äù ‚Äî meaning that the innovation portion of SOAR is mostly a thing of the past. But even they admit that SOAR functionality has staying power and can be found in numerous other security tools.\n\n\n\nForrester Research partitions SOAR products into several categories: platforms, products that focus on threat intelligence, and those that are more centered around automation tasks. GigaOm divides the space into its own three categories of SOAR-only pure plays, full security platforms that integrate with other tool collections, and crossover products that originate from IT service management and automation segments. However you slice it, the SOAR market segment has more than 30 vendors.\n\n\n\nWhy you might need SOAR\n\n\n\nThe core reason for SOAR originally was it would be a major kingpin in an organization‚Äôs defensive posture. They were the first tools to not just discover a potential threat but automate a way to remove it and improve overall security. The goal was ‚Äî and still is ‚Äî to reduce the amount of time before a threat is found and resolved.\n\n\n\nAs security alerts have proliferated, the need to quickly classify and resolve them has gotten greater. ‚ÄúDay-to-day tactical activities take up too much time,‚Äù said Forrester‚Äôs Allie Mellen in the SOAR report. ‚ÄúSOAR technology provides security teams a way to automate some of these repetitive tasks and coordinate across tools from a single technology.‚Äù\n\n\n\nHowever, in recent years, as malware has gotten sneakier and attackers more adept, SOAR is just one weapon against these threats. Security has become more nuanced and integrated with case management and collaboration tools to become more effective. Some SOAR vendors have added machine learning techniques so that past events can help improve detection and eliminate false positives annoyances. Machine learning is of course not unique to SOAR and further blurs the lines between SOAR and other security tools that tout more autonomous operations and threat responses.\n\n\n\nThese are all great reasons, but one mitigating factor against SOAR is that these are expensive products, with prices around $300,000 per year or more. While there could be savings in not hiring additional SOC analysts or in finding malware quickly with the right SOAR, it could also mean that you might require hiring other analysts who need to be experienced with creating automated workflows to operate these products.\n\n\n\nTrends in the SOAR market\n\n\n\nLarge security vendors have widened their integrations with other vendors‚Äô SOAR products, with some offering hundreds of third-party integrations. This means they can ingest various security signals such as SIEM tools, log analyzers, and endpoint detectors. This means ‚Äúthat SOAR tools can start running independently of SIEM tools to strengthen an organization‚Äôs security posture and automate nonsecurity processes as well,‚Äù said GigaOm‚Äôs Andrew Green in his October 2024 report linked above.\n\n\n\nOne example of this trend is the recently announced Security Incident Response service from AWS. This brings together a collection of various signals from across the entire AWS collection, tying together its GuardDuty and Security Hub monitoring services along with a human incident response team.\n\n\n\nMany vendors have tied their SOAR and SIEM tools together, such as Palo Alto Networks‚Äô Cortex, Microsoft‚Äôs Sentinel, and Netwitness‚Äô Orchestrator. Swimlane and D3Security offer only a SOAR product, and both have wide third-party integrations.\n\n\n\nAnother trend is from a growing threat from API-based attacks and increasing sophistication. Kong has found in its latest survey that half of respondents have experienced these threats in the past year. This means that better detection and response automation is needed, with a broader scope to figure out what is going on across an enterprise network.\n\n\n\nOne way to do this is to leverage AI and machine learning. For example, according to AIM Research, ‚Äúvendors are broadening their offerings with genAI-powered AI agents, copilots, context-aware AI assistants, automation and analytics security platforms, and attack training simulators. We are now noticing a rise in the integration of generative AI-specific capabilities into cybersecurity tools.‚Äù Swimlane Turbine SOAR and BlinkOps both have their AI copilots and AI-infused low-code playbook generators. Fortinet has its FortAI and Google has its Gemini AI SecLM module that can provide more contextual guidance and execute commands.\n\n\n\nAnomali has taken another approach. It doesn‚Äôt sell a separate standalone SOAR product, but adds its functionality with its AI-based copilot to its SIEM Security Analytics and ThreatStream intelligence tools. OpenText does something similar with its Enterprise Security Manager, essentially tossing in SOAR and AI functionality as part of the overall package.\n\n\n\nBut AI by itself means a staff needs to coordinate what is being automated and when. Forrester‚Äôs Mellen recommended in 2022 that security teams should ‚Äúcoordinate with other automation talent in other parts of the business,‚Äù such as with staff of a ‚Äúcenter of excellence‚Äù to help build better SOC automation processes. ‚ÄúOften, companies have a lone analyst who maintains their SOAR tool,‚Äù and this collaboration could have big payoffs.\n\n\n\nFinally, the best SOAR products come in a variety of packages: for on-premises installations as either a dedicated hardware appliance or standalone software and one of three virtual configurations including as a virtual machine image, a public cloud service or as full SaaS/managed service. This gives these tools flexibility in where they are placed across an enterprise infrastructure and what they are protecting. No SOAR vendor offers all these options. Fortinet, Rapid7, and ServiceNow offer hardware options (but not all of the others), while Palo Alto Networks, Swimlane, and Tines offer all other options except the hardware package.\n\n\n\nKey features to look for\n\n\n\nSOAR products span a wide range of features and protective measures. Here are a few of the key features that can differentiate them:\n\n\n\n\nHow wide is the third-party integration envelope? Each SOAR vendor claims to have hundreds of integrations to others‚Äô products, which is part of the product category‚Äôs secret sauce. But that means the SOAR experience can vary widely from installation to installation. Just citing the raw number of integrations is meaningless: for example, a vendor can integrate with dozens or more AWS services, or just S3, so it pays to get the specifics. We have linked to the online catalogs where available.\n\n\n\nHow many prebuilt workflows come included? BlinkOps claims thousands of automated flowflows, but just as important is the process to create custom ones. Some vendors offer visual low-code editors or AI-enhanced creation tools.\n\n\n\nHow does the product avoid alert fatigue and false positives? The best tools cross-reference their signals to filter out false positives, such as leveraging multiple threat intelligence sources. Tines has a rather innovative way to use a Notion database combined with Elastic Security. D3Security claims its product can eliminate at least 90% of alerts automatically and has a free ROI calculator that possibly can quantify their benefit. Microsoft claims its tool eliminates up to 84% of false positives.\n\n\n\nWhat about finding zero-day threats? Again, combining signals and feeds with automation processes can help to more quickly identify and neutralize zero-days.\n\n\n\nDoes the product serve nonsecurity or general orchestration purposes? As mentioned in the individual specifics of each product, some of the SOAR tools have branched out into nonsecurity areas, such as tracking file access and network traffic, or tracking employee life cycle and asset management or synchronizing with trouble ticketing systems and general application development alerts. Many vendors, with the notable exceptions of Google‚Äôs SOAR and Microsoft‚Äôs Sentinel, are already moving in this direction.\n\n\n\n\nThe major SOAR providers and their offerings\n\n\n\nBlinkOps from Blink has hundreds of integrations listed here that span a wide variety of third-party software tools. It has thousands of prebuilt automated workflows (for example, Google Cloud Platform has 360 such automations) that span those that can run on preset schedules or with particular web hook triggers. It comes with two different AI copilots, one for building new workflows and one for automated case management. It also supports non-security automation and orchestration uses. Pricing starts at $17,500 per year.\n\n\n\nD3Security Smart SOAR has more than 600 connectors to a variety of tools. The company says it will build anything that isn‚Äôt in this list for free. It has automations that handle incidents, search for false positives, and trigger mitigation responses. D3 also handles nonsecurity cases, such as employee onboarding and offboarding. The minimum annual price is $100,000. It plans to add a series of AI-based tools in early 2025 to help make customization more productive and effective.\n\n\n\nFortinet FortiSOAR has more than 600 connectors to a variety of other tools as well as tight integrations with other Fortinet products such as its SIEM, firewall, and XDR. Data is enriched with hundreds of threat intelligence sources, and the companion FortAI tool provides more analysis, creates playbooks, and executes simple commands. It can also be used for nonsecurity tasks such as employee onboarding or offboarding and equipment provisioning. It is available in SaaS, on-premises software, and cloud versions. Pricing comes in two tiers: starter and enterprise.\n\n\n\nGoogle Security Operations SOAR is just one module of many components that have their roles in its Chronicle observability service. It supports more than 250 third-party integrations across all major security categories, including gathering data from various Google security and cloud services. It requires a SIEM connection (Google‚Äôs or others) to collect data. It works with Mandiant‚Äôs threat intelligence and alerts are sent in near real-time to the SOAR dashboard. It has a three-tier pricing structure.\n\n\n\nIBM QRadar SOAR on-premises. In early 2024, IBM sold its QRadar SaaS version to Palo Alto Networks, keeping the Open Shift and virtual machine. It supports more than 300 third-party integrations listed in its marketplace, along with connectors to its Guardium and Verify product lines. QRadar also integrates with its Watson AI-based app dev studio, which when coupled with its Playbook Designer can be used to develop custom playbooks and workflows. It has been extended to nonsecurity use cases, such as employee onboarding and management. Unlike most of its competitors, it has a very transparent pricing estimator, based on the number of authorized users, that starts around $10,000 per year.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel is a cloud-native dual SIEM and SOAR service that uses Azure analytic services. It can collect data from multiple cloud and on-premises sources with a variety of connectors, including prebuilt ones for its own Defender products as well as third-party tools such as AWS S3, various Google Cloud services, Jira Audit, and Okta that can be found on the Azure Marketplace. Microsoft has also written extensive migration plans from Splunk and QRadar SOAR tools and has AI-enhanced automation of workbooks with its Azure Logic Apps tool. It is available as a preview version with various usage-based pricing tiers but without the need for an 365/E5 Defender license, and free to try out for the first month with certain usage limits.\n\n\n\nPalo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR has more than 1,000 third-party integrations that can be reviewed on its marketplace covering both security and nonsecurity tools. The product has integrations with other security, network, and cloud tools from the vendor. It uses AI-enhancements to group and filter duplicate alerts, eliminate false positives, and create playbooks as well as learning from manual analyst interactions. XSOAR also works with a variety of large language models, including ChatGPT, Anything LLM, and Ollama, to analyze and interact with incident data.\n\n\n\nServiceNow Security Incident Response supports hundreds of third-party integrations across a wide variety of security products to enrich its data collection of incidents. This includes connecting with many ServiceNow modules for security, network, compliance, asset collection, and other IT-related issues. It works with three AI-based tools: Flow Designer, a visual drag-and-drop workflow creator; Predictive AIOps, for analyzing event logs; and Now Assist, for case management.\n\n\n\nSplunk SOAR. Cisco completed its acquisition of Splunk early in 2024 and it now integrates with more than 300 third-party tools and Splunk‚Äôs Enterprise Security and Attack Analyzer products. It comes with more than 2,800 prebuilt automated workflows that can be easily tied to playbooks that can be constructed with a visual editor. A future integration is promised with Cisco‚Äôs Talos Intelligence threat feed. Splunk has an AI assistant for its Search Processing Language, enabling natural language prompting of queries. Splunk can also be applied to nonsecurity cases such as IT operations.\n\n\n\nSwimlane Turbine has a wide catalog of hundreds of third-party integrations to a variety of security tools. This is enabled thanks to support for a variety of connections, including general Rest APIs, webhooks, various telemetry sensors, and business logic tools. Swimlane claims to be the largest independent SOAR provider, meaning that it doesn‚Äôt offer any of its own SIEM or XDR companion products. It does have Turbine Canvas, an AI-based low-code automator, and Hero AI, used to automate playbooks for case management. Pricing starts at $720,000 per year, with additional usage fees (such as for AI consumption) on top of this.\n\n\n\nTines has an extensive ecosystem of dozens of prebuilt third-party integrations with vulnerability management, the three major cloud platforms, and various EDR and SIEM vendors. Users can quickly build workflows to automate processes, including using its AI-powered Workbench. It can also automate various nonsecurity tasks such as employee onboarding or offboarding and asset management. There are both always-free and for-fee versions that start at $170,000 per year and can easily be double that amount for more complex installations.\n\n\n\nOther SOAR providers include Exabeam, NetWitness, and SentinelOne; these providers declined to provide any specifics on their SOAR products.\n\n\n\nWhat about the price of SOAR?\n\n\n\nUnlike IBM and Microsoft, few of the SOAR vendors offer full public and transparent pricing. Three counter examples are Tines‚Äôs pricing page, Splunk‚Äôs pricing page, and Google‚Äôs pricing page. All of these are long on details on how their prices are calculated without providing any actual dollar amounts. The others just ignore pricing altogether.\n\n\n\nWe obtained pricing from cloud providers‚Äô managed service offerings, which may or may not be representative of other packaging options. The range is quite large, starting at about $20,000 per year. The top cost goes to Swimlane, which starts at the jaw-dropping annual fee of $720,000 and can go a lot higher for usage surcharges. Clearly, SOAR isn‚Äôt just an acronym, and the lack of pricing transparency means the sky is the limit. Potential customers will have to negotiate with vendor sales teams to obtain meaningful pricing.\n\n\n\nQuestions to ask your team and your SOAR vendor\n\n\n\n\nDoes the product offer more protection and automation features than using either an XDR or SIEM tool?\n\n\n\nHow wide and agnostic is your support for multiple third-party security vendors?\n\n\n\nWhat integrations (to other security tools offered by the same vendor) are available? How is this data enriched and combined within the SOAR?\n\n\n\nHow is your workflow automation enabled?\n\n\n\nWhat large language models and AI tools are used to enhance its features?\n\n\n\n\nEssential Reading\n\n\n\n\nWhat is SIEM?

      "contentSnippet": "Illustration: The Verge\n  \n\n Apple is refuting rumors that it ever let advertisers target users based on Siri recordings in a statement published Wednesday evening describing how Siri works and what it does with data. \nThe section specifically responding to the rumors reads:\nApple has never used Siri data to build marketing profiles, never made it available for advertising, and never sold it to anyone for any purpose. We are constantly developing technologies to make Siri even more private, and will continue to do so. \nThe conspiracy theory the company is responding to resurfaced last week after Apple agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit over users whose conversations were captured by its Siri voice assistant and potentially overheard by human employees. \nWhile Apple‚Äôs settlement addresses an issue that The Guardian reported in 2019. The report showed human contractors tasked with reviewing anonymized recordings and grading whether the trigger was activated intentionally, would sometimes receive recordings of people discussing sensitive information. But it doesn‚Äôt include any reference to selling data for marketing purposes. \n\nHowever, reports about the settlement noted that in earlier filings like this one from 2021, some of the plaintiffs claimed that after they mentioned brand names like ‚ÄúOlive Garden,‚Äù ‚ÄúEaston bats,‚Äù ‚ÄúPit Viper sunglasses,‚Äù and ‚ÄúAir Jordans,‚Äù they were served ads for corresponding products, which they attributed to Siri data. Apple‚Äôs statement tonight says that it ‚Äúdoes not retain audio recordings of Siri interactions unless users explicitly opt in to help improve Siri, and even then, the recordings are used solely for that purpose. Users can easily opt-out at any time.‚Äù \nFacebook responded to similar theories in 2014 and 2016, before Mark Zuckerberg addressed it directly, saying ‚Äúno‚Äù to the question while being grilled by Congress over the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018.\nSo, if Apple (and Facebook, Google, etc.) is telling the truth, then why would you see an ad later for something you only talked about? \nThere are other explanations, and attempts to check the rumors out include an investigation in 2018 that didn‚Äôt find evidence of microphone spying but did discover that some apps secretly recorded on-screen user activity that they shipped to third parties. \nAd targeting networks also track data from people logged onto the same network or who have spent time in the same locations, so even if one person didn‚Äôt type in that search term, maybe someone else did. They can buy data from brokers who collect reams of detailed location tracking and other info from the apps on your phone, and both Google and Facebook pull in data from other companies to build out profiles based on your purchasing habits and other information.",

      "contentSnippet": "The Detroit-based company Astrohaus has been making its ‚Äúdistraction-free writing tools‚Äù under the Freewrite name for about a decade. So far, those have all been standalone, single-purpose devices meant simply for drafting text, but Astrohaus is branching out at CES 2025. The company just announced a mechanical keyboard called the Freewrite Wordrunner, a device designed specifically with writers in mind.\nThis comes more than three years after Astrohaus quietly revealed intentions to build a keyboard, originally known as the Maestro. But the company eventually pulled the plug on its planned 2022 launch, and I hadn‚Äôt heard anything about it since then ‚Äî it seems that they‚Äôve just been working away at it this whole time. CEO Adam Leeb said in a press release that the company had been iterating and developing it for almost four years.\nFreewrite\nMechanical keyboards have largely become the domain of gamers; the company wanted to build a device for people who make their living writing instead. Without spending some quality time with it, I can‚Äôt say if they‚Äôve hit that mark yet, but there are some fun ideas on display here.\nThe Wordrunner has a tenkeyless design that looks familiar at first glance, but you‚Äôll quickly notice that the function row has been replaced by a custom set of keys that‚Äôll make zipping around text documents faster. That includes find and replace, undo and redo, paragraph up and down as well as back, forward and reload keys. I‚Äôd be upset about losing media controls from the function row, but the Wordrunner has it covered with the bright red joystick / button. It moves in all four cardinal directions, can be turned like a knob and can also be pressed in vertically to skip tracks, change volume or pause your tunes.\nNathan Ingraham for Engadget\nOn the other side, you‚Äôll find three customizable macro keys with the cutesy names ‚Äúzap,‚Äù ‚Äúpow‚Äù and ‚Äúbam.‚Äù They‚Äôre programmable for anything you might want, but Astrohaus suggested using them to launch specific writing apps, converting text to title case or inserting the date. I don‚Äôt yet know what I‚Äôd use them for, but having customizable keys is a table-stakes feature for most enthusiast keyboards so I‚Äôm glad to see them here.\nProbably the most visually striking thing about the Wordrunner are the two mechanical counters you‚Äôll see up top. One is a timer you can use for writing sprints or just staying focused for a bit. More intriguing is the Wordometer dead-center at the top of the keyboard. It‚Äôll track your words with its whopping eight-digit mechanical counter, and since it saves your word count as long as you want, you could try and max it out someday. Of course, you can also reset it at any time or pause it if you don‚Äôt want it to advance while you‚Äôre chatting with friends or sending emails.\nNathan Ingraham for Engadget\nThe mechanical keys are backlit and use Kailh switches; the keycaps are replaceable but the switches aren't. It also has some sound dampening built in so you can use it without subjecting everyone around to you overly loud key clacks (this may be a plus or minus depending on how you like your keyboards). As for connectivity, the Wordrunner uses Bluetooth or USB-C, and you can pair the keyboard with three different devices and quickly switch between them with dedicated hotkeys.\nI got a chance to play with a prototype of the Wordrunner, and my first impressions was \"wow, this is heavy!\" It's a thick slab of polished aluminum that matches the finish of the premium Hemingway edition of the Smart Typewriter. Astrohaus founder / CEO Adam Leeb told me that the company was shooting to make this keyboard feel like a premium, limited edition with the finish even if they're planning for it to be part of the permanent portfolio.\nNathan Ingraham for Engadget\nWhile I didn't get to try the Wordrunner hooked up to a computer, I still got to see the mechanical Wordometer turn over when I started typing. It's quite satisfying to see it count up as I wrote an imaginary story on it, and there's a small LED that's green when the counter is turned on and red when you turn it off. The keys and travel all felt great, and the joystick was similarly a lovely tactile experience ‚Äî I'm looking forward to using it like a volume knob for media. Leeb says that this keyboard is still a prototype, but it feels quite polished and nearly final to me.¬†\nFinally, there‚Äôs the ever-present question of availability. Astrohaus is launching the Wordrunner on Kickstarter, as it has done with most of its other hardware over the last 10 years. The campaign should start in February with early bird pricing, but we don‚Äôt know what that price will be yet. Fortunately, there‚Äôs a pretty low-commitment way to get the best price if you‚Äôre curious. Astrohaus says you can place a $1 reservation for priority access and the best possible pricing, with plans to deliver the first batch of keyboards before the end of the year. That‚Äôs a long ways out, but a buck isn‚Äôt a bad investment if you‚Äôre interested.\nUpdate, January 8 2024, 9:27PM ET: This article has been updated to include some hands-on impressions and photos of the Wordrunner.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/the-latest-freewrite-device-is-a-fancy-mechanical-keyboard-built-with-writers-in-mind-220005961.html?src=rss",

      "contentSnippet": "Apple today reiterated its commitment to Siri privacy, making it clear that ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå data has never been used to build marketing profiles, nor has any ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå information been made available to advertisers or sold for any purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's newsroom post comes after it settled a class action lawsuit related to ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå for $95 million. Plaintiffs accused Apple of recording conversations captured after accidental ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå activations, and then sharing information from those conversations with third-party advertisers.\r\n\r\nTwo plaintiffs claimed that after speaking about products like Air Jordan shoes and Olive Garden, their Apple devices showed ads for those products, while another said he received ads for a surgical treatment after discussing it privately with his doctor.\r\n\r\nThere has never been any indication that Apple shared ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå recordings, and Apple told MacRumors in a statement earlier this week that the lawsuit was settled to avoid additional litigation.\r\n\r\nIn its full privacy overview, Apple goes into detail on the ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå privacy protections that are in place to keep user data safe. Apple uses on-device ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå processing wherever possible, and minimizes the amount of data that's collected as much as possible.\r\n\r\n‚ÄåSiri‚Äå searches and requests are not associated with an Apple Account and cannot be linked to an individual user, with Apple instead using a random identifier to keep track of data as it's processed.\r\n\r\nApple says that it does not retain audio recordings of ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå interactions unless users explicitly opt in to help improve ‚ÄåSiri‚Äå, and even then, recordings are used just for that purpose.Tags: Apple Privacy, SiriThis article, \"Apple Highlights Privacy Commitment After Settling Siri Spying Lawsuit\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "contentSnippet": "The latest Apple Watch SE is an entry-level smartwatch if there ever was one. | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n  \n\n In September, Apple launched its latest smartwatch, introducing the Apple Watch Series 10 alongside a black rendition of the Apple Watch Ultra 2. Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before ‚Äî and a lot more deals to be had.\n\nBut with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 11, launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or Series 5 behind.\nThat being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you‚Äôre getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.\nNow, let‚Äôs get to the deals.\n\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\n\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple‚Äôs flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that‚Äôs brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.\n\nWhile the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn‚Äôt a vast departure from the prior model, the Series 9. That being said, you can already pick it up at Amazon and Best Buy in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329 ($70 off), which matches the wearable's best price to date. The GPS-equipped model is also on sale at Amazon and Best Buy in the 46mm variant for $359 ($70 off), while the LTE models can be had at Amazon and Best Buy starting at $429 ($70 off).\n\nRead our Apple Watch Series 10 review.\nThe best Apple Watch Series 9 deals\n\n\nIn 2023, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 9 alongside the second-gen Ultra. It uses Apple‚Äôs last-gen S9 SiP chip and a second-gen ultra wideband chip, which allows for onboard Siri processing and precision finding with select iPhone models. It also features a brighter, 2,000-nit display and support for Apple‚Äôs nifty ‚Äúdouble tap‚Äù feature ‚Äî two minor additions that are also present on the Series 10.\n\nThe Series 9 has been out for more than a year, but certain configurations have become increasingly difficult to find with the arrival of Apple‚Äôs latest watch. Luckily, the GPS-equipped Series 9 is still on sale in the 45mm configuration at Walmart starting at $279 ($150 off), or at Amazon and Best Buy in the 41mm sizing starting at $299 ($100 off). There are also a handful of deals to be had on the LTE models with cellular connectivity, though none of them undercut the current price of the LTE-equipped Series 10 model by much, hence their exclusion here.\n\nRead our Apple Watch Series 9 review.\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\n\n\nThe Apple Watch SE received a refresh in late 2022. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you‚Äôre after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation‚Äôs baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration).\n\nAt the moment, the best deals on the latest Apple Watch SE can be found at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy, where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS for $199 ($50 off). The 44mm configuration, meanwhile, is available at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $229 ($50 off). If you want the LTE configuration, the 40mm configuration is currently on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $249 ($50 off), or in the larger 44mm sizing at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $279 ($50 off), its typical sale price.\n\nRead our Apple Watch SE (second-gen) review.\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\n\nThe latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that‚Äôs 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple‚Äôs S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.\n\nIn recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it‚Äôs only on sale at Amazon and Best Buy with a Trail Loop starting at $719.99 (about $79 off), or with an Alpine Loop at Amazon starting at $759 ($40 off). You can also pick it up at Amazon with an Ocean Band starting at $769 ($30 off), which is about $80 more than the lowest price we‚Äôve seen on the elastomer-equipped model.\n\nRead our Apple Watch Ultra 2 review.\nA note on the more premium models\nWhile all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings ‚Äî polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they‚Äôre never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don‚Äôt include them here.",

      "link": "https://www.csoonline.com/article/3652369/ivanti-warns-critical-rce-flaw-in-connect-secure-exploited-as-zero-day.html",
      "contentSnippet": "IT software provider Ivanti released patches Wednesday for its Connect Secure SSL VPN appliances to address two memory corruption vulnerabilities, one of which has already been exploited in the wild as a zero-day to compromise devices.\n\n\n\nThe exploited vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-0282, is a stack-based buffer overflow rated as critical with a CVSS score of 9.0. The flaw can be exploited without authentication to achieve remote code execution and impacts Ivanti Connect Secure, Ivanti Policy Secure, and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA gateways.\n\n\n\nThe second vulnerability, CVE-2025-0283, is also a stack-based buffer overflow impacting the same products but requires authentication to exploit and can only lead to privilege escalation. It‚Äôs rated as high severity with a CVSS score of 7.0.\n\n\n\nAccording to Ivanti‚Äôs advisory, CVE-2025-0282 was exploited in ‚Äúa limited number of customers‚Äô Ivanti Connect Secure appliances‚Äù but the company is not aware of in-the-wild exploitation against Ivanti Policy Secure and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA gateways yet.\n\n\n\nAs for CVE-2025-0283, that vulnerability was discovered internally while investigating CVE-2025-0282, and there‚Äôs no evidence that it has been exploited. The flaws do not need to be chained for a successful attack.\n\n\n\nFor now, patches are available only for Ivanti Connect Secure, with patches for Policy Secure and Neurons planned for Jan. 21. That‚Äôs more than enough time for the patches to be reverse engineered and for proof-of-concept exploits to be developed and adopted by attackers.\n\n\n\nHowever, Ivanti points out that Policy Secure is not supposed to be exposed to the internet, lowering the risk. It advises all customers to make sure the appliance is configured according to official recommendations.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Neurons ZTA gateways cannot be exploited in production when connected to a ZTA controller. Only gateways generated and left unconnected are at risk of exploitation.\n\n\n\nFor Connect Secure the company advises customers to upgrade to version 22.7R2.5 and to perform scans with the internal and the external Integrity Checker Tool (ICT), which should detect signs of compromise.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúFactory reset on appliances with a clean ICT scan is recommended before putting 22.7R2.5 in production out of an abundance of caution,‚Äù the company said.\n\n\n\nThe CVE-2025-0283 vulnerability impacts both the 22.x and 9.x versions of Connect Secure, althought the 9.x branch, which reached end-of-life on Dec. 31, will not receive a patch. The CVE-2025-0282 flaw impacts only the 22.x branch.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúThreat actor activity was identified by the Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) on the same day it occurred, enabling Ivanti to respond promptly and rapidly develop a fix,‚Äù the company said in a blog post. ‚ÄúWe continue to work closely with affected customers, external security partners, and law enforcement agencies as we respond to this threat. We strongly advise all customers to closely monitor their internal and external ICT as a part of a robust and layered approach to cybersecurity to ensure the integrity and security of the entire network infrastructure.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe company credits Google‚Äôs Mandiant and Microsoft‚Äôs Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) for collaborating in the response, so it‚Äôs possible more details about the attacks that exploited the vulnerability will be released at a later date by these companies as has happened in the past.\n\n\n\nThis is just the latest of several vulnerabilities in Ivanti products exploited in the wild as zero days by APT groups over the past year. In February 2024, the US government went so far as to order agencies to take Ivanti VPNs offline.\n\n\n\nThe company has not publicly released indicators of compromise observed for this latest exploit but said such information will be shared on request with customers that have confirmed impact with the ICT scans.",

      "link": "https://www.csoonline.com/article/3637864/un-agencys-job-application-database-breached-42000-records-stolen.html",
      "contentSnippet": "The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on Tuesday said that it is ‚Äúactively investigating reports of a potential information security incident allegedly linked to a threat actor known for targeting international organizations,‚Äù and has initially concluded that ‚Äúapproximately 42,000 recruitment application data records from April 2016 to July 2024‚Äù were stolen.\n\n\n\nIn its initial statement, the ICAO said, ‚ÄúWe can confirm that this incident is limited to the recruitment database and does not affect any systems related to aviation safety or security operations.‚Äù\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, ICAO officials elaborated on that statement during an email exchange between CSO Online and ICAO communications officer William Raillant-Clark, who said, ‚ÄúICAO began its probe as soon as the claims were brought to our attention‚Äù on January 5, 2025.\n\n\n\nBut even if the systems impacting security were not directly affected, the information stolen could be used by attackers to impersonate airline officials with access to sensitive areas, according to Johannes Ullrich, the dean of research at the SANS Institute, which provides cybersecurity certifications and research.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very risky‚Äù because ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know how [the attackers] are going to use the data that they now control. They could apply to jobs with that information,‚Äù Ullrich said. ‚ÄúIf they have the information from a solid job application and they can impersonate them, it could place them in places of trust. It might be in backend systems that exchange flight data and such, potentially disrupting air travel.‚Äù\n\n\n\nWhen asked how ICAO can say that the flight systems are not endangered by the breach, Raillant-Clark said that his agency can‚Äôt predict what the attackers will do with the stolen data.¬†\n\n\n\nHe said, ‚Äúwe are not in a position to validate claims or other statements made by external parties, and nor are we in a position to speculate on their intent.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe agency said that the data was ‚Äúclaimed to be released by the threat actor known as Natohub.‚Äù\n\n\n\nReports have identified Natohub as the alias a data thief uses on BreachForum, a cyberthief forum and marketplace.¬†¬†\n\n\n\nWithout getting specific, ICAO said, ‚Äúwe have implemented additional security measures to protect our systems. We are also working to identify and notify affected individuals.‚Äù\n\n\n\nExtensive data stolen\n\n\n\n‚ÄúThe compromised data includes recruitment-related information that applicants entered into our system, such as names, email addresses, dates of birth, and employment history,‚Äù the initial ICAO statement said. ‚ÄúThe affected data does not include financial information, passwords, passport details, or any documents uploaded by applicants.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThere have been many reports of attacks on job application databases because they tend to have massive amounts of personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive information.¬†\n\n\n\nAdding to the cybersecurity problem is the fact that many enterprises tend to outsource these sites to third parties who may not have the most robust protections.\n\n\n\nOne of the weaknesses in job application systems is the ability for applicants to upload files. ‚ÄúAllowing uploading of files, especially PDFs, is one of the most dangerous things a system can allow,‚Äù¬† Ullrich said, noting it could let attackers upload malware.\n\n\n\n‚ÄúThese employment application databases are always targets because they have a lot of information‚Äù and many companies ‚Äúcollect more data than they really need,‚Äù he said.¬†\n\n\n\nFor example, Ullrich pointed to the ICAO statement that dates of birth were stolen. ‚ÄúDo they really need to ask that that early in the process?‚Äù\n\n\n\n‚ÄúI hope that they have strong evidence that it was not leaked,‚Äù he said, adding that the best tactics to protect such information is to encrypt as much data as possible and implement an automated mechanism to move data off of a public environment into a closed secure environment as quickly as possible.¬†\n\n\n\nUllrich also questioned the portion of the ICAO statement that detailed what had not been stolen. Given that breach reports are routinely updated and expanded, it‚Äôs much safer to say what was definitely stolen and not discuss what initially appears to have not been stolen.\n\n\n\nCombatting these issues requires sophisticated, experienced cybersecurity talent, which ‚Äúyou often don‚Äôt find in these outsourced vendors‚Äù handling job application functions, Ullrich said.¬†\n\n\n\nGiven that the data grabbed spanned more than eight years, it seems likely that it was stored for an extensive period.¬†\n\n\n\nHe also questioned whether the attacker had actually targeted the UN agency, or whether it was just an attack of opportunity, where the attacker found holes in the third-party job application firm‚Äôs platform and was systematically going after all of its customers.¬†\n\n\n\nThe attacker might be just ‚Äútaking out sites created by this vendor,‚Äù Ullrich said. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs very possible that [ICAO] was not targeted, and was just caught because of someone fishing for sites with a particular vulnerability.‚Äù",

      "contentSnippet": "Visitors to the Home Appliances wing of LG Electronics‚Äô vast CES 2025 exhibit will likely be drawn first to the most visually enticing new products: a breakthrough LG Signature Microwave oven, redesigned indoor gardening appliances, and a hyper helpful robot that couldn‚Äôt be cuter.¬† Stuff that makes for cheery Eyewitness TV news coverage and social influencer posts from the giant tech show.\n\n\n\nBut sorry, gang, you‚Äôll really be missing something important if you don‚Äôt also pay attention to the modest looking cylindrical object plotzed on an LG booth table. While the LG ThinQ ON home hub is intentionally muted in appearance to blend in with any space and d√©cor, it‚Äôs the AI-enhanced, smart home assistant that could prove the most helpful to your home life.\n\n\n\nWhat‚Äôs so hot about a Microwave?\n\n\n\n‚ÄúNot much has changed in microwaves through the years,‚Äù noted my seasoned tour guide John I. Taylor, Senior VP of LG Electronics USA, Inc. But the times they are a-changing with the LG Signature Over-the-Range Microwave, which not only excels in cooking and heating food but also delivers an immersive entertainment experience.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tLG Electronics\n\n\n\nOn command, the glass front of the microwave‚Äôs door reveals itself to be a 27-inch wide Full HD (1080P) touchscreen display with a variety of uses. Activating ‚ÄúInstaView‚Äù triggers three inside cameras to offer real-time cook monitoring and time-lapse image creation (great fodder for food bloggers.) And should you pair this microwave with the new, likewise camera-fitted LG Signature Slide-in Double Range, that microwave screen can also keep you in the know as things are cooking down below, without the need to stoop or open an oven door.\n\n\n\nBut wait, there‚Äôs more. The 27-inch screen also comes with built-in speakers and Wi-Fi connectivity, to bring a variety of entertainment content to the kitchen whilst you‚Äôre cooking or eating. The screen likewise offers access to the LG ThinQ Smart Home Dashboard, becoming an oversized smart pad to control all your LG AI appliances and compatible Matter and Thread devices.\n\n\n\nMore kitchen kapers\n\n\n\nWhile we‚Äôre in the foodie zone, pay attention to the new 36-inch Smart InstaView French Door Refrigerator. Its upgraded, fully transparent T-OLED display embedded in the upper right door functions as both a digital touch interface and a Dual InstaView panel to show what‚Äôs inside the fridge without opening the door and letting the chill out.\n\n\n\nOn the kinda wild and weird side, Hologram like visuals can also be activated on said screen, blending the virtual with the real, while music plays from your curated playlist. That refrigerator‚Äôs inside camera functions pragmatically, too, with LG‚Äôs ThinQ Food management system to automatically recognize stored food items, suggest ‚Äúwill-work-with-that-stuff‚Äúrecipes and warn when favored items are running low or about to expire.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tLG Electronics\n\n\n\nUpgraded proximity sensors are at play in the sleek LG Signature Dishwasher, with a handle that sits flush with the door when not in use then automatically pops out when a hand approaches. And on the laundry front, LG ‚Äòs top washer is exploiting AI DD‚ÄîArtificial Intelligence Direct Drive 2.0‚Äîto recognize and optimize fabric care settings. It‚Äôs spooky smart.\n\n\n\nHow does your apartment garden grow?\n\n\n\nBoth functional and decorative, LG‚Äôs new-gen, indoor gardening appliances merge an advanced growing system with a spiffy look. Downward-facing lights support optimal plant growth during the day while upward-facing mood lighting illuminates the crop and creates a calming ambiance in the evening.\n\n\n\nThese mini arborteums have smarts, of course, automatically dispensing the right amount of water (from a 1.5 gallon tank) and nutrients to care for the specific number and variety of plants being grown, even when users are away for extended periods (up to a week.) Forthcoming in both a floor lamp standing model and in a side table styled design, users can use the companion ThinQ app to control the lighting settings, monitor growth, and manage cultivation schedules from across the room or halfway around the world.\n\n\n\nSay hey, hubbie\n\n\n\nLG has coined its deployments of AI as ‚ÄúAffectionate Intelligence.‚Äù And nowhere is that more evident than in its (tentatively named) Q9 Self-Driving AI Home Hub: a home agent that moves freely around the premises, interacts with the residents and recognizes situations and context to trigger appropriate actions of ThinQ connected appliances.\n\n\n\nLG touts this two-wheeled bot as ‚Äúthe first product to realize the concept of providing ‚Äòcare services‚Äô in the smart home domain by actively controlling appliances, saving energy, and offering care through a combination of IoT, appliance data, user conversation context, and lifestyle patterns. ‚Äú\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tLG Electronics\n\n\n\nIf Q9 sees the cat knock over its food bowl, the hub will send a message to your robot vac to clean up the mess. And when it hears ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs kinda chilly in here,‚Äù it‚Äôll tell your smart thermostat to crank up the furnace or heat pump. And if you slip and fall and can‚Äôt up, you could ask it to summon help.\n\n\n\nLG‚Äôs John Taylor is most taken by this companion device‚Äôs charming ability to concoct a story from drawings and/or to read a book out loud .‚ÄúYou just put the page or image in front of the camera at the top of the display, and it will extract the text or dream up a story¬† from the drawing, then voice and act it out with various expressions and motions.‚Äú While LG is touting this AI skill as primarily for children, the LG exec thinks ‚Äúit could also be quite helpful for any one with impaired vision.‚Äù\n\n\n\nAlso coming to everyone‚Äôs rescue‚ÄîQ9 will provide GPT-4o-generated answers to questions practical, mundane, or far-fetched without ever complaining ‚Äústop pestering me.‚Äù\n\n\n\nSaving the best for last\n\n\n\nWhile the maker might wish you would only buy LG appliances that are remotely controllable via its ThinQ OS and app, they‚Äôre cognizant that users have also invested in appliances and Internet of Things (IoT) devices operating on a variety of other platforms. To serve as a peace maker, help them all work and cooperate from a single app, it‚Äôs soon to bring us ThinQ ON, a smart home hub product that applies generative AI to the task of home management.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tLG Electronics\n\n\n\nThinQ On is largely based on the Homey Pro smart hub from Athom, a Dutch company that LG took a majority interest in (an 80 percent stake) in July, 2024. More than a decade in development, the current Homey Pro can connect to more than 50,000 devices, load up with apps from an options list numbering near 1,000, including standard protocols such as Matter, Thread, and Zigbee; plus, connection methods defined separately by each manufacturer. Adding disparate products and platforms via an on-screen menu is reportedly straightforward and easy, according to most reviewers.\n\n\n\nOne differentiator from Homey: the ThinQ On hub will offer onboard voice activation with that Affectionate Intelligence:‚ÄúOur secret sauce,‚Äù says Taylor. Operation entails using a large language model and the ThinQ platform to understand the user‚Äôs context, enabling natural conversation for the operation of home appliances and home IoT devices. It identifies the users‚Äô intention, suggests routines appropriate to the situation and can juggle multiple issues when necessary.\n\n\n\nAsk it to start the washing machine, unaware that the detergent dispenser is empty, and ThinQ On will first alert you of that situation and hold off starting the cycle until the dispenser has been filled. If it knows (from a connected smart watch) that you were exercising earlier the same day, it will pre-set the wash cycle for ‚Äúactive wear.‚Äù\n\n\n\nThe beauty of this computerized hub is that it functions locally, independent of the internet except for software loading/updating. Local control delivers enhanced privacy, and eliminates dependence on your home‚Äôs connection to the internet. That‚Äôs quite from the cloud-based, cross-platform schema in development by the Home Connectivity Alliance, an organization similarly ‚Äúdedicated to the development and promotion of safe and secure interoperability across long-life appliances, HVAC systems and TVs within the connected home ecosystem.‚Äù LG is a member of that alliance, which was supposed to deliver the goods by the end of 2024. But you what happens to the best-laid plans.\n\n\n\nAlso prepped to offer smart speaker entertainment thrills (music, news, and weather on demand) , the ThinQ On hub will first appear for sale later this year in Korea, LG‚Äôs home territory and primo R&D stomping ground, we‚Äôre told. Same goes for the Q9 Self-Driving AI Home Hub.\n\n\n\nThose new kitchen and laundry appliances should all be circling the globe in due course in 2025.\n\n\n\nPrices have yet to be announced on any of the products but for the smart hub curious, we can take some guidance from the current $399 price tag on the Homey Pro and the $199 asking price for the soon-to-come, less-powerful Homey Pro mini. ¬†",

      "contentSnippet": "Speculation over how incoming U.S. President Donald Trump plans to harden the country‚Äôs borders and carry out mass deportations, the place of biometrics in border control programs and the budgets those programs will have has reached a fever pitch.\r\n\r\nThe Trump campaign was heavily focused on increasing border control and promises to deport illegal immigrants, both of which would entail identifying people who are crossing or have crossed the border. Civil society groups and media outlets warn that these efforts have warned that ‚Äútechno-solutionism‚Äù applied to immigration could easily be turned against Americans.\r\n\r\nPresident-elect Trump told NBC News in the wake of the election that his deportation plan would have \"no price tag.\" And Thomson Reuters notes that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued an RFI for GPS tracking and biometric monitoring devices the day after the election.\r\n\r\nAn opinion piece published by The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists points out that shares in GEO Group, a prison company whose subsidiary BI Inc. manages the SmartLINK facial recognition app through which ICE monitors migrants, jumped by 73 percent following the election.\r\n\r\nBut as many observers have noted, biometrics contracts with ICE have also expanded under the outgoing Democratic Party Administration.\r\n\r\nChanges and more restrictive border policies are being planned, however.\r\n\r\nRepublican lawmakers including House Speaker Mike Johnson have said that the preferred approach to the legislative changes needed to enact the President‚Äôs desired policies at the border and elsewhere is the passage of a single, comprehensive bill. The bill would be voted on through a ‚Äúreconciliation‚Äù process, allowing a simple Senate majority of 50 votes for approval instead of the 60 normally required under a filibuster rule, The Guardian reports.\r\n\r\nPresident Trump is even taking credit for Canadian investments in drones and helicopters for border security.",

      "contentSnippet": "‚ÄúYou are now entering a safety zone,‚Äù says a voice over the loudspeaker, as Arnold Schwarzenegger strides toward an X-ray body scanner deployed at a border checkpoint on Mars. ‚ÄúNo unauthorized weapons allowed beyond this point.‚Äù When Arnold and his compatriots walk through the corridor, their scanned bone biometrics show up as green skeletons behind a black screen.\r\n\r\nThe scene is from the 1990 science fiction film Total Recall. While the airports of 2025 are not yet equipped with breeze-through visual scanners like this, new developments in biometric scanning technology are getting us close. In 2024, for the first time, the TSA screened more than three million people in a single day, as travelers made their way home after Thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nThat crunch led to delays, cancellations and suspensions ‚Äì underlining the need for more efficient passenger processing to accommodate passenger numbers that continue to climb.\r\nLeidos extends ongoing contract with TSA for IT, logistics\r\nAn article published on the website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security explores how the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) are collaborating on tech to ‚Äúreimagine imaging at the airport.‚Äù\r\n\r\nKey to the plan is the TSA‚Äôs relationship with Leidos. The Virginia-based biometrics firm traces its incumbency as a main provider of IT and logistics services to the TSA in support of airport screening equipment back to 2013.\r\n\r\nAccording to Washington Technology, it has now won a potential seven-year, $2.6 billion contract to continue its role in the Integrated Logistics Support program, which oversees passenger and baggage screening equipment at 448 domestic airports in the U.S.\r\n\r\nLeidos won the prior recompete bid in 2019 at a $926.5 million ceiling, now increased to $1 billion.\r\nTech for S&T Screening at Speed Program uses non-harmful radio waves\r\nFor S&T, the objective is captured in its Screening at Speed Program, which uses high definition imaging to expedite the screening process.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThe Screening at Speed Program is working with the Department of Energy‚Äôs Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to develop improved detection capabilities and a more user-friendly passenger experience,‚Äù says the piece. ‚ÄúHigh Definition-Advanced Imaging Technology (HD-AIT) is the backbone of this development.‚Äù\r\n\r\nThe proffered description of HD-AIT locates it not far from Arnold‚Äôs sci-fi tunnel. The tech ‚Äúuses non-harmful radio waves known as millimeter waves that pass through natural and synthetic materials to generate high-resolution data,‚Äù the article says.\r\n\r\n‚ÄúMillimeter waves can penetrate through fabrics to screen for concealed objects, including non-metallic objects that traditional metal detectors aren‚Äôt designed to detect. However, the millimeter waves are completely safe as they are 10,000 times less powerful than cell phone signals and don‚Äôt penetrate the skin.‚Äù\r\n\r\nThe data is ‚Äúprocessed by an algorithm that protects passenger privacy and provides results on a generic representative human figure for Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) to review.‚Äù Human officers will conduct secondary screening as needed.\r\nThrough the screening glass: Real-Time AIT\r\nFor now, the stated benefits of HD-AIT deployments ‚Äì available in standalone or retrofit prototype versions ‚Äì are improved detection and better passenger experience, in that passengers could be allowed to keep on light jackets, sweaters and shoes during screening. Augmentations like a dedicated shoe scanner (rumored to be on display at CES in Las Vegas) show the potential for further improvement.\r\n\r\nWhile a trip to Mars is still out of scope, ‚ÄúReal-Time Advanced Imaging Technology builds upon the HD-AIT technology, increases its capability, and places it inside modular panel sensors to collect images at video rates as passengers walk-by or move in front of the panels.‚Äù\r\n\r\nThe more forward leaning Real-Time AIT ‚Äúmay eventually allow standard passengers to be screened at walking speeds, similar to a metal detector.‚Äù\r\n\r\nIn other words, a Total Recall total recall.\r\nWest Virginia mobile driver‚Äôs licenses now on TSA\r\nIn more pedestrian news on digital ID for travel, TSA checkpoints with digital ID readers nationwide are now accepting mobile driver licenses (mDLs) issued by West Virginia.\r\n\r\nA release says travelers who have downloaded the West Virginia Mobile ID app to their phone can use it for identity verification during the screening process. The app is free for all state residents, and is provided by Idemia Public Security North America.\r\n\r\nWest Virginia is the fourteenth state to offer digital IDs compatible with TSA‚Äôs credential authentication technology. Other states offering TSA-approved mDLs are Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Puerto Rico and Utah.\r\n\r\nThe TSA website has a map of airports that accept digital ID credentials.",

      "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202501/dhs-unveils-playbook-for-deployment-of-ai-by-the-public-sector",
      "contentSnippet": "The Department of Homeland Security‚Äôs (DHS) just published Playbook for Public Sector Generative Artificial Intelligence Deployment outlines a comprehensive framework for integrating generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) responsibly into public sector operations. The report prioritizes key considerations such as privacy, security, civil rights, transparency, and online authentication.\r\n\r\nDHS said, ‚ÄúThe playbook is designed to meet organizations wherever they are in their journey to understand and incorporate AI technology in their work. Any public sector organization can start today to assess and gather resources, cultivate internal buy-in, and lay the groundwork for effective deployments of GenAI.‚Äù\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThe release of this playbook marks a significant step forward in our efforts to integrate safe and secure AI use responsibly and effectively within the public sector,‚Äù said DHS Chief Information Officer Eric Hysen. ‚ÄúBy sharing our experiences and best practices, we aim to empower other government agencies to leverage AI in a way that enhances their missions while safeguarding the rights and privacy of the individuals they serve.‚Äù\r\n\r\nDHS said that ‚Äúthe rapid advancement and commercialization of GenAI presents both significant opportunities and challenges for [DHS] and public sector organizations at all levels,‚Äù and noted that ‚Äúin alignment with Executive Order 14110, which emphasizes the responsible deployment of AI technologies, [it] has proactively initiated GenAI pilot programs to explore their potential in enhancing our mission capabilities.‚Äù\r\n\r\n‚ÄúThese pilot initiatives have provided valuable insights into the practical applications of GenAI within our operations,‚Äù DHS says, and ‚Äúhave underscored the importance of a measured and thoughtful approach to AI integration, ensuring that our deployments are responsible, trustworthy, and effective while protecting privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.‚Äù\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, DHS released an Artificial Intelligence Roadmap describing its plans to guide its responsible use of AI while ensuring individuals‚Äô privacy rights, civil rights, and civil liberties are protected.\r\n\r\nOne of the playbook‚Äôs central themes is safeguarding individual privacy during GenAI deployment. DHS emphasizes stringent controls over the handling of sensitive data, particularly in scenarios where GenAI interfaces with public or personal information. To mitigate risks, DHS requires clear guidelines that define what data can be shared with GenAI systems and restricts unauthorized use.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Impact Assessments are integral to this framework, ensuring that all uses of GenAI comply with federal privacy laws and regulations, DHS said. Furthermore, the playbook mandates human oversight in evaluating GenAI outputs, reinforcing the principle that these tools must supplement human decision-making rather than replacing it entirely. By embedding privacy professionals into pilot Integrated Project Teams, DHS sys it has created a culture of proactive privacy management that minimizes risks such as data breaches or inadvertent exposure of sensitive information.\r\n\r\nThe playbook also underscores the necessity of robust cybersecurity measures when implementing GenAI systems. Recognizing the potential vulnerabilities inherent in AI systems, DHS developed security guidelines tailored for critical infrastructure and public sector applications. These measures include comprehensive risk assessments, system testing for adversarial robustness, and stringent compliance with existing cybersecurity protocols.\r\n\r\nGenAI deployments must be integrated into secure IT environments, which often require custom configurations or the use of specialized models such as open-weight AI systems for offline operations. DHS says this adaptability is particularly crucial for sensitive applications such as law enforcement investigations or immigration services where data security is paramount. The playbook also advises continuous monitoring of GenAI tools to enable early detection and mitigation of security threats.\r\n\r\nEnsuring the ethical application of GenAI is a cornerstone of DHS‚Äôs framework. The playbook repeatedly stresses the importance of aligning AI use with constitutional rights, civil liberties, and anti-discrimination laws. GenAI must not perpetuate or exacerbate biases, whether in training data or its outputs. This principle is critical in areas like immigration processing, where any algorithmic bias could have significant consequences for individuals.\r\n\r\nTo safeguard civil rights, DHS says it has embedded oversight professionals -including civil liberties experts - into every stage of the pilot process. This collaborative approach allows for the real-time identification of risks and the implementation of corrective actions, fostering trust in GenAI systems. For example, the requirement for transparency and explainability in GenAI tools ensures that all stakeholders, including the public, can understand how decisions are made.\r\n\r\nTransparency is pivotal in building trust in GenAI deployments. DHS says it has committed to openly sharing non-sensitive uses of GenAI through its AI Use Case Inventory, a resource designed to inform the public and other stakeholders about the applications of AI across the department. This initiative aligns with broader government mandates for accountability in AI systems.\r\n\r\nThe playbook also emphasizes the importance of iterative feedback and usability testing to refine GenAI tools. Stakeholder engagement, both internal and external, is a recurring theme. By soliciting input from users, oversight bodies, and the public, DHS says its has created mechanisms to enhance system transparency and usability while addressing emerging concerns.\r\n\r\nWhile not a primary focus, the playbook additionally addresses online authentication challenges within GenAI deployment. Ensuring that users and systems interacting with GenAI are properly authenticated is a fundamental security measure. DHS proposes integrating GenAI with existing authentication frameworks, such as multi-factor authentication and digital identity verification, to bolster system integrity. These safeguards are particularly important in applications involving access to confidential data or high-stakes decision-making environments.\r\n\r\nThe playbook defines responsible GenAI use as aligning AI systems with democratic values and societal goals. Trustworthiness is achieved through characteristics such as reliability, safety, transparency, and fairness. To operationalize these principles, DHS has established comprehensive guidelines for evaluating GenAI systems, including their accuracy, interpretability, and potential impacts on civil rights.\r\n\r\nDHS has also developed training programs to ensure employees are well-versed in the capabilities and limitations of GenAI. These programs aim to instill a shared understanding of responsible AI practices across the DHS enterprise. This approach not only mitigates risks, but it also fosters a culture of ethical innovation, DHS says.\r\n\r\nThe playbook also advocates for a structured governance model that incorporates diverse stakeholders, from technical experts to civil liberties professionals. By building cross-functional teams, DHS says it has ensured that GenAI deployments benefit from a broad spectrum of expertise and perspectives. Governance structures also provide a framework for addressing the ethical, legal, and operational challenges posed by GenAI.\r\n\r\nThe DHS Playbook for Public Sector GenAI Deployment represents a critical step forward in integrating AI responsibly into government operations. By addressing privacy, security, civil rights, transparency, and online authentication, the framework ensures that GenAI deployments are both effective and aligned with societal values.\r\n\r\nThe playbook‚Äôs holistic approach not only mitigates risks but also sets a standard for how public sector organizations can harness the transformative potential of AI responsibly and ethically. As DHS continues to refine its strategies, its playbook serves as a foundational guide for advancing trustworthy AI in service of the public good.",

      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/mine-detector",
      "contentSnippet": "Land mines have been around in one form or another for more than a thousand years. By now, you‚Äôd think a simple and safe way of locating and removing the devices would‚Äôve been engineered. But that‚Äôs not the case. In fact, up until World War II, the most common method for finding the explosives was to prod the ground with a pointed stick or bayonet. The hockey-puck-size devices were buried about 15 centimeters below the ground. When someone stepped on the ground above or near the mine, their weight triggered a pressure sensor and caused the device to explode. So mine clearing was nearly as dangerous as just walking through a minefield unawares.During World War II, land mines were widely used by both Axis and Allied forces and were responsible for the deaths of 375,000 soldiers, according to the Warfare History Network.In 1941 J√≥zef Stanislaw Kosacki, a Polish signals officer who had escaped to the United Kingdom, developed the first portable device to effectively detect a land mine without inadvertently triggering it. It proved to be twice as fast as previous mine-detection methods, and was soon in wide use by the British and their allies.The Engineer Behind the Portable Mine DetectorBefore inventing his mine detector, Kosacki worked as an engineer and had developed tools to detect explosives for the Polish Armed Forces.After receiving a bachelor‚Äôs degree in electrical engineering from the Warsaw University of Technology in 1933, Kosacki completed his year-long mandatory service with the army. He then joined the National Telecommunications Institute in Warsaw as a manager. Then, as now, the agency led the country‚Äôs R&D in telecommunications and information technologies. In 1937 Kosacki was commissioned by the Polish Ministry of National Defence to develop a machine that could detect unexploded grenades and shells. He completed his machine, but it was never used in the field.\n\nPolish engineer J√≥zef Kosacki‚Äôs portable land-mine detector saved thousands of soldiers‚Äô lives in World War II. Military Historical OfficeWhen Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Kosacki returned to active duty. Because of his background in electrical engineering, he was placed in a special communications unit that was responsible for the upkeep of the Warszawa II radio station. But that duty lasted only until the radio towers were destroyed by the German Army a month after the invasion.With Warsaw under German occupation, Kosacki and his unit were captured and taken to an internment camp in Hungary. In December 1939, he escaped and eventually found his way to the United Kingdom. There he joined other Polish soldiers in the 1st Polish Army Corps, stationed in St. Andrews, Scotland. He trained soldiers in the use of wireless telegraphy to send messages in Morse code.Then tragedy struck.Tragedy Inspired Engineering Ingenuity The invention of the portable mine detector came about after a terrible accident on the beaches of Dundee, Scotland. In 1940, the British Army, fearing a German invasion, buried thousands of land mines along the coast. But they didn‚Äôt notify their allies. Soldiers from the Polish 10th Armored Cavalry Brigade on a routine patrol of the beach were killed or injured when the land mines exploded. This event prompted the British Army to launch a contest to develop an effective land-mine detector. Each entrant had to pass a simple test: Detect a handful of coins scattered on the beach. Kosacki and his assistant spent three months refining Kosacki‚Äôs earlier grenade detector. During the competition, their new detector located all of the coins, beating the other six devices entered.There‚Äôs some murkiness about the detector‚Äôs exact circuitry, as befits a technology developed under wartime security, but our best understanding is this: The tool consisted of a bamboo pole with an oval-shaped wooden panel at one end that held two coils‚Äîone transmitting and one receiving, according to a 2015 article in Aerospace Research in Bulgaria. The soldier held the detector by the pole and passed the wooden panel over the ground. A wooden backpack encased a battery unit, an acoustic-frequency oscillator, and an amplifier. The transmitting coil was connected to the oscillator, which generated current at an acoustic frequency, writes Mike Croll in his book The History of Landmines. The receiving coil was connected to the amplifier, which was then linked to a pair of headphones. \n\nThe detector weighed less than 14 kilograms and operated much like the metal detectors used by beachcombers today. Micha≈Ç Bojara/National Museum of Technology in WarsawWhen the panel came close to a metallic object, the induction balance between the two coils was disturbed. Via the amplifier, the receiving coil sent an audio signal to the headphones, notifying the soldier of a potential land mine. The equipment weighed just under 14 kilograms and could be operated by one soldier, according to Croll. Kosacki didn‚Äôt patent his technology and instead gave the British Army access to the device‚Äôs schematics. The only recognition he received at the time was a letter from King George VI thanking him for his service. Detectors were quickly manufactured and shipped to North Africa, where German commander Erwin Rommel had ordered his troops to build a defensive network of land mines and barbed wire that he called the Devil‚Äôs Gardens. The minefields stretched from the Mediterranean in northern Egypt to the Qattara Depression in western Egypt and contained an estimated 16 million mines over 2,900 square kilometers.Kosacki‚Äôs detectors were first used in the Second Battle of El Alamein, in Egypt, in October and November of 1942. British soldiers used the device to scour the minefield for explosives. Scorpion tanks followed the soldiers; heavy chains mounted on the front flailed the ground and exploded the mines as the tank moved forward. Kosacki‚Äôs mine detector doubled the speed at which such heavily mined areas could be cleared, from 100 to 200 square meters an hour. By the end of the war, his invention had saved thousands of lives.\n\nKosacki‚Äôs land-mine detector was first used in Egypt, to help clear a massive minefield laid by the Germans. The basic technology continued to be used until 1991.National Army MuseumThe basic design with minor modifications continued to be used by Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States until the end of the First Gulf War in 1991. By then, engineers had developed more sensitive portable detectors, as well as remote-controlled mine-clearing systems. Kosacki wasn‚Äôt publicly recognized for his work until after World War II, to prevent retribution against his family in German-occupied Poland. When Kosacki returned to Poland after the war, he began teaching electrical engineering at the National Centre for Nuclear Research, in Otwock-≈öwierk. He was also a professor at what is now the Military University of Technology in Warsaw. He died in 1990. The prototype of Kosacki‚Äôs detector shown at top is housed at the museum of the Military Institute of Engineering Technology, in Wroclaw, Poland. Land Mines Are Still a Worldwide ProblemLand-mine detection has still not been perfected, and the explosive devices are still a huge problem worldwide. On average, one person is killed or injured by land mines and other explosive ordnance every hour, according to UNICEF. Today, it‚Äôs estimated that 60 countries are still contaminated by mines and unexploded ordnance.Although portable mine detectors continue to be used, drones have become another detection method. For example, they‚Äôve been used in Ukraine by several humanitarian nonprofits, including the Norwegian People‚Äôs Aid and the HALO Trust.Nonprofit APOPO is taking a different approach: training rats to sniff out explosives. The APOPO HeroRATs, as they are called, only detect the scent of explosives and ignore scrap metal, according to the organization. A single HeroRAT can search an area the size of a tennis court in 30 minutes, instead of the four days it would take a human to do so. Part of a continuing series looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology. An abridged version of this article appears in the January 2025 print issue as ‚ÄúThe First Land-Mine Detector That Actually Worked.‚ÄùReferences There are many well-known Polish scientists, such as Marie Curie, whose discoveries and research made history. As a first-generation Polish-American, I wanted to learn more about the engineering feats of unknown innovators in Poland. After scouring museum websites, I came across J√≥zef Kosacki and his portable mine detector.To learn more about his life and work, I read excerpts of Przemyslaw Slowinski and Teresa Kowalik‚Äôs 2020 book, Kr√≥lewski dar: Co Polska i Polacy dali ≈õwiatu (‚ÄúRoyal Gifts: What Poland and Poles Gave the World‚Äù).I also read several articles about Kosacki on both Polish and Scottish websites, including the Polish Press Agency, Wielka Historia (Great History), and Curious St. Andrews, which covers the history of the city.To learn more about the history of land mines, I read articles published by the nonprofit APOPO, the BBC, and the U.S. Army. APOPO researches, develops, and implements land-mine detection technology to clear minefields in Africa.",

      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/geopolitics-and-technology",
      "contentSnippet": "Over the last year, Spectrum‚Äôs editors have noticed an emerging through line connecting several major stories: the centrality of technology to geopolitics. Last month, our cover story, done in partnership with Foreign Policy magazine, was on the future of submarine warfare. And last October, we focused on how sea drones could bolster Taiwan‚Äôs ‚Äúsilicon shield‚Äù strategy, which rests on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.‚Äôs domination of high-end chip manufacturing. So when I asked the curator of this issue, Senior Editor Samuel K. Moore, what he saw as the major theme as we head into 2025, I wasn‚Äôt surprised when he said, without hesitation, ‚Äúgeopolitics and technology.‚Äù In fact, the same day Sam and I spoke, I forwarded to Spectrum‚Äôs Glenn Zorpette a news item about China banning the export to the United States of gallium, germanium and antimony. China‚Äôs overwhelming command of rare earths like these is at the heart of Zorpette‚Äôs story in this issue. ‚ÄúInside an American Rare Earth Boomtown‚Äù paints a vivid picture of how the United States is trying to nurture a domestic rare earth mining and processing industry. China, meanwhile, is itself looking to minimize its own dependence on imported uranium by building a thorium-based molten-salt reactor in the Gobi Desert. And tensions between China and Taiwan will undoubtedly be further stressed with the opening of TSMC‚Äôs first advanced wafer fab in the United States this year.The mitigation of climate change is another key area where politics informs tech advances. In ‚ÄúStartups Begin Geoengineering the Sea‚Äù, Senior Associate Editor Emily Waltz takes readers aboard a pair of barges anchored near the Port of Los Angeles. There, two companies, Captura and Equatic, are piloting marine carbon-capture systems to strip CO2 out of ocean water. Whether the results can be measured accurately enough to help companies and countries meet their carbon-reduction goals is an open question.One way for the international community to study the impacts of these efforts could be Deep‚Äôs Sentinel program, the first part of which will be completed this year. Our correspondent Liam Critchley, based in England, reports in ‚ÄúMaking Humans Aquatic Again‚Äù that Deep, located in Bristol, is building a modular habitat that will let scientists live underwater for weeks at a time.Another geopolitical concern also lies at sea: the vulnerability of undersea fiber-optic cables, which carry an ever-growing share of the world‚Äôs Internet traffic. The possibility of outages due to attack or accident is so worrying that NATO is funding a project to quickly detect undersea-cable damage and reroute data to satellites. In a provocative commentary on why technology will define the future of geopolitics published in Foreign Affairs in 2023, Eric Schmidt, chair of the Special Competitive Studies Project and the former CEO and chair of Google, argues that ‚Äúa country‚Äôs ability to project power in the international sphere‚Äîmilitarily, economically, and culturally‚Äîdepends on its ability to innovate faster and better than its competitors.‚Äù In this issue, you‚Äôll get an idea of how various nations are faring in this regard. In the coming year, you can look forward to our continuing analysis of how the new U.S. administration‚Äôs policies on basic research, climate change, regulation, and immigration impact global competition for the raw materials and human resources that stoke the engines of innovation.",

      "title": "As EV Sales Stall, Plug-In Hybrids Get a Reboot",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/plug-in-hybrid",
      "contentSnippet": "Automakers got one thing right: Electrified cars are the future. What they got wrong was assuming that all of those vehicles would run on battery power alone, with gasoline-electric hybrid technology bound for the technological scrap heap.\n\n\t Now the automaking giants are scrambling to course correct. They‚Äôre delaying their EV plans, rejiggering factories, and acknowledging what some clear-eyed observers (including \n\tIEEE Spectrum) suspected all along: Not every car buyer is ready or able to ditch the internal-combustion engine entirely, stymied by high EV prices or unnerved by a patchy, often-unreliable charging infrastructure.\n\n\n\t\tThis article is part of our special report \n\t\tTop Tech 2025.\n\t\n\n\tConsumers are still looking for electrified rides, just not the ones that many industry pundits predicted. In \n\tChina, Europe, and the United States, buyers are converging on hybrids, whose sales growth is outpacing that of pure EVs. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs almost been a religion that it‚Äôs EVs or bust, so let‚Äôs not fool around with hybrids or hydrogen,‚Äù says Michael Dunne, CEO of Dunne Insights, a leading analyst of China‚Äôs auto industry. ‚ÄúBut even in the world‚Äôs largest market, almost half of electrified vehicle sales are hybrids.‚Äù\n\n\t In China, which accounts for about two-thirds of global \n\telectrified sales, buyers are flocking to plug-in hybrids, or PHEVs, which combine a gas engine with a rechargeable battery pack. Together, hybrids and all-electric vehicles (a category that the Chinese government calls ‚Äúnew energy vehicles‚Äù) reached a milestone last July, outselling internal-combustion engine cars in that country for the first time. PHEV sales are up 85 percent year-over-year, dwarfing the 12-percent gain for pure EVs.\n\n\t The picture is different in the United States, where customers still favor conventional hybrids that combine a gas engine with a small battery‚Äîno plug involved, no driver action required. Through September 2024, this year‚Äôs conventional hybrid sales in the United States have soared past 1.1 million, accounting for 10.6 percent of the overall car market, versus an 8.9 percent share for pure EVs, according to \n\tWards Intelligence. Including PHEVs, that means a record 21 percent of the country‚Äôs new cars are now electrified.\n\n\tBut even as overall EV sales rise, plug-in hybrid sales have stalled at a mere 2 percent of the U.S. market. A J.D. Power \n\tsurvey also showed low levels of satisfaction among PHEV owners.\n\n\t Those numbers are a disappointment to automakers and regulators, who have looked to PHEVs as a bridge technology between gasoline vehicles and pure EVs. But what if the problem isn‚Äôt plug-in tech per se but the type of PHEVs being offered? Could another market pivot be just around the corner?\nPlug-in Hybrids: The Next Generation\n\tThe Ram brand, a part of \n\tStellantis, is betting on new plug-in technology with its Ram 1500 Ramcharger, a brash full-size pickup scheduled to go on sale later this year.\n\n\tThe Ramcharger is what‚Äôs known as an extended-range electric vehicle, or EREV. An EREV resembles a PHEV, pairing gas and electric powertrains, but with two key differences: An EREV integrates much larger batteries, enough to rack up significant all-electric miles before the internal-combustion engine kicks in; and the gas engine in an EREV is used entirely to generate electricity, not to propel the car directly.\n\nBMW demonstrated EREV tech beginning in 2013 with its pint-size i3 REx, which used a tiny motorcycle engine to generate electricity. The Chevrolet Volt, produced from 2010 to 2019, also used its gasoline engine largely as a generator, although it could partially propel the car in certain conditions. The short-lived 2012 Fisker Karma took a similar approach. None of these vehicles made much impact on the market. As a large pickup with conventional styling, the Ramcharger appears to be a more mainstream proposition.\n\n\nThe platform for the 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger includes a V6 engine, a 92-kilowatt-hour battery pack, and a 130-kilowatt generator. Stellantis\n\n\tThe Ramcharger shares its STLA Frame platform and electrical architecture with the upcoming pure-battery \n\tRam 1500 REV, but it‚Äôs designed to provide more driving range, along with the option of gasoline fill-ups when there are no EV chargers around. Although the Ramcharger‚Äôs 92-kilowatt-hour battery has less than half the capacity of the Ram REV‚Äôs humongous upgraded 229-kWh battery (the largest ever in a passenger EV), it‚Äôs hardly small. The Ramcharger still packs more battery power than many all-electric vehicles, such as the Ford Mustang Mach-E and the Tesla Model 3.\n\n\tOriginally, Ram planned to launch its EV pickup first. But based on consumer response, the brand decided to prioritize the Ramcharger; the Ram 1500 REV will now follow in 2026.\n\n\t Ram estimates that its pickup will travel about 233 kilometers (145 miles) on a fully charged battery, more than three times the stated 71-km electric range of a compact \n\tToyota Prius Prime, among the U.S. market‚Äôs longest-range PHEVs. For typical commuters and around-town drivers, ‚Äúthat‚Äôs enough range where you could really use this truck as an EV 95 percent of the time,‚Äù says Ed Kim, chief analyst of AutoPacific.\n\n\tWhen the battery runs down below a preset level, the gasoline engine kicks in and generates 130 kilowatts of electricity to the battery, which continues to feed the permanent-magnet motors that propel the car. Since the motors do all the work, an EREV mimics an EV, needing no conventional transmission or driveshaft. But the onboard generator enables the Ramcharger to drive much farther than any conventional EV can.\nExtended-Range EVs: The Long Haul\n\tWith batteries and gasoline working in tandem, the Ramcharger has an extended range of 1,110 km (690 miles), dwarfing the 824-km range of the \n\tLucid Air Grand Touring, the current EV long-distance champ. And unlike many PHEVs, whose performance suffers when they rely on battery juice alone, the Ramcharger doesn‚Äôt skimp on power. The system churns up a mighty 494 kW (663 horsepower) and 834 newton-meters of torque. Ram estimates the Ramcharger will go from 0 to 60 miles per hour (0 to 97 kilometers per hour) in 4.4 seconds.\n\n\tUsing the engine solely as a generator also addresses a couple of key criticisms of PHEVs: skimpy all-electric range, especially if the owner rarely bothers to plug it in, and compromised efficiency when the car runs primarily on gasoline.\n\n\t ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs PHEVs can be extremely efficient or extremely inefficient, all depending on how a customer decides to use it,‚Äù Kim says. ‚ÄúIf they never plug in, it ends up being a hybrid that‚Äôs heavier than it needs to be, hauling around a battery it doesn‚Äôt really use.‚Äù\n\n\tIn an EREV, by contrast, the engine can operate constantly in its most frugal operating range, which maximizes its thermal efficiency, rather than constantly revving from idle to high speeds and wasting fuel.\n\n\t The Ramcharger should also excel at actual hauling. Some truck loyalists have soured on all-electric pickups like the \n\tFord F-150 Lightning, whose maximum 515-km range can drop by 50 percent or more when it‚Äôs towing or hauling heavy loads. The Ramcharger is rated to tow up to 14,000 pounds (6,350 kilograms) and to handle up to 2,625 pounds (1,190 kg) in its cargo bed. Company officials insist that its range won‚Äôt be unduly dinged by heavy lifting, although they haven‚Äôt yet revealed details.\nChina Embraces EREVs\n\tIf China is the bellwether for all things electric, the EREV could be the next big thing. EREVs now make up nearly a third of the nation‚Äôs plug-in-hybrid sales, according to \n\tBloomberg New Energy Finance. Beijing-based Li Auto, founded nine years ago by billionaire entrepreneur Xiang Li, makes EREVs exclusively; its sales jumped nearly 50 percent in 2024. Big players, including Geely Auto and SAIC Motor Corp., are also getting into the game.\n\n\nLi Auto‚Äôs Li L9, shown here at a 2024 auto show in Tianjin, China, is an extended-range hybrid SUV designed for China‚Äôs wide-open spaces.NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\n\tThe \n\tLi L9 is a formidable example of China‚Äôs EREV tech. The crossover SUV pairs a 44.5-kWh nickel cobalt manganese battery with a 1.5-liter turbo engine, for a muscular 330 kW (443 horsepower). Despite having a much smaller battery than the Ramcharger, the all-wheel-drive L9 can cover 180 km on a single charge. Then its four-cylinder engine, operating at a claimed 40.5 percent thermal efficiency, extends the total range to 1,100 km, perfect for China‚Äôs wide-open spaces.\n\n\t Dunne notes that in terms of geography and market preferences, China is more similar to the United States than it is to Europe. All-electric EVs predominate in China‚Äôs wealthier cities and coastal areas, but in outlying regions‚Äîcharacterized by long-distance drives and scarce public charging‚Äîmany Chinese buyers are spurning EVs in favor of hybrids, much like their U.S. counterparts.\n\n\t Those parallels may bode well for EREV tech in the United States and elsewhere. When the Ramcharger was first announced in November 2023, it looked like an outlier. Since then, Nissan, Hyundai, Mazda, and General Motors‚Äô Buick brand have all announced EREV plans of their own.\n\n\nVolkswagen‚Äôs Scout Traveler SUV, due out in 2027, is another entry in the extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) category.Scout Motors\n\n\tIn October, Volkswagen unveiled a revival of the Scout, the charming off-roaders built by International Harvester between 1960 and 1980. The announcement came with a surprise twist: Both the Scout Traveler SUV and Scout Terra pickup will offer EREV models. (In a nod to the brand‚Äôs history, Scout‚Äôs EREV system is called ‚ÄúHarvester.‚Äù) The hybrid versions will have an estimated 500-mile (800-km) range, easily beating the 350-mile (560-km) range of their all-electric siblings. According to a crowdsourced tracker, about \n\tfour-fifths of people reserving a Scout are opting for an EREV model.\nToyota Gets the Last Laugh\n\tFor \n\tToyota, the market swing toward hybrid vehicles comes as a major vindication. The world‚Äôs largest automaker had faced withering attacks for being slow to add all-electric vehicles to its lineup, focusing more on hybrids as a transitional technology. In 2021, Toyota‚Äôs decision to redesign its Sienna minivan exclusively as a hybrid seemed risky. Its decision to do the same with the 2025 Camry, America‚Äôs best-selling sedan, seemed riskier still. Now Toyota and its luxury brand, Lexus, control nearly 60 percent of the hybrid market in North America.\n\n\nToyota was criticized for sticking with hybrid cars like the Prius, but it now controls nearly 60 percent of the North American hybrid market. Toyota\n\n\tAlthough Toyota hasn‚Äôt yet announced any plans for an EREV, the latest Toyota Prius shows the fruits of five generations and nearly 30 years of hybrid R&D. A 2024 Prius starts at around $29,000, with up to 196 horsepower (146 kW) from its 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle engine and tiny lithium-ion battery‚Äîenough to go 0-97 km/h in a little over 7 seconds. The larger 2025 Camry hybrid is rated at up to 48 miles per gallon (20 kilometers per liter).\n\n\t Market analysts expect the \n\tToyota RAV4, the most-popular SUV in the United States, to go hybrid-only around 2026. David Christ, Toyota‚Äôs North American general manager, indicated that ‚Äúthe company is not opposed‚Äù to eventually converting all of its internal-combustion models to hybrids.\n\n\tMeanwhile, GM, Ford, Honda, and other brands are rapidly introducing \n\tmore hybrids as well. Stellantis is offering plug-in models from Jeep, Chrysler, and Dodge in addition to the EREV Ramcharger. Even the world‚Äôs most rarefied sports-car brands are adopting hybrid technology because of its potential to improve performance significantly‚Äîand to do so without reducing fuel economy. [For more on high-performance hybrids, see \"A Hybrid Car That's Also a Supercar\".]\n\nThe electricity-or-nothing crowd may regard hybrids as a compromise technology that continues to prop up demand for fossil fuels. But by meeting EV-skeptical customers halfway, models that run on both batteries and gasoline could ultimately convert more people to electrification, hasten the extinction of internal-combustion dinosaurs, and make a meaningful dent in \n\tcarbon emissions.",

      "contentSnippet": "Aside from having four wheels, it‚Äôs hard to see what a US $30,000 Toyota Camry has in common with a $3 million Ferrari F80. But these market bookends are examples of an under-the-radar tech revolution. From budget transportation to hypercars, every category of internal-combustion car is now harnessing hybrid tech. In ‚ÄúAs EV Sales Stall, Plug-In Hybrids Get a Reboot,‚Äù I describe the vanguard of this new hybrid boom: extended-range EVs like the 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger, which boasts a range of more than 1,000 kilometers. The world‚Äôs leading performance brands are also embracing hybrid EV tech‚Äînot merely to cut emissions or boost efficiency but because of the instant-on, highly controllable torque produced by electric motors. Hybridized models from BMW, Corvette, Ferrari, and Porsche are aimed at driving enthusiasts who have been notoriously resistant to electric cars. Sam Fiorani, vice-president of global vehicle forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions, predicts that ‚Äúnearly all light-duty internal-combustion engines are likely to be hybridized in one form or another over the next decade.‚Äù Even mainstream electrified models, Fiorani notes, routinely generate acceleration times that were once limited to exotic machines. ‚ÄúThe performance offered by electric motors cannot be accomplished by gas-powered engines alone without impacting emissions,‚Äù Fiorani says. ‚ÄúThe high-end brands will need to make the leap that only an electric powertrain can practically provide.‚Äù That leap is well underway, as I experienced firsthand during test drives of the BMW M5, Corvette E-Ray, and Ferrari 296 GTB. These performance hybrids outperform their internal-combustion-only equivalents in almost every way. Most incorporate all-wheel-drive, along with torque vectoring, energy harvesting, and other engineering tricks that are possible with the inclusion of electric motors.2025 BMW M5: The Heavyweight Hybrid\n\nThe BMW M5 sedan is a literal heavyweight, tipping the scales at 2,435 kilograms.BMW The 2025 BMW M5 sedan adds plug-in hybrid power to one of the company‚Äôs iconic models. A twin-turbo, 4.4-liter V-8 engine pairs with a fifth-generation BMW eMotor and a 14.8-kilowatt-hour battery. The M5 can cruise silently on battery power for 69 km (43 miles). The biggest downside is the car‚Äôs crushing curb weight‚Äîup to 2,500 kilograms (5,500 pounds)‚Äîand poor fuel economy once its electric range is spent. The upside is 527 kilowatts (717 horsepower) of Teutonic aggression, which I experienced from Munich to the Black Forest, making Autobahn sprints at up to 280 kph (174 mph). Ferrari 296 GTB and F80: Top of the Hybrid Food Chain\n\nAlthough the Ferrari 296 GTB is a plug-in hybrid, its goal is high performance, not high gas mileage.Ferrari Ferrari‚Äôs swoopy 296 GTB is a plug-in hybrid with a 122-kW electric motor sandwiched between a 3.0-liter V-6 and an F1 automated gearbox, producing a total of 602 kilowatts (819 horsepower). The 296 GTB can cover just 25 km on electricity alone, but that could be enough to pass through European low-emission zones, where internal-combustion cars may eventually be banned. Of course, the 296 GTB‚Äôs main goal is high performance, not high gas mileage. A digital brake-by-wire system makes it Ferrari‚Äôs shortest-stopping production car, and the brakes regenerate enough energy that I was able to recharge the 7.5-kWh battery on-the-fly in roughly 10 minutes of driving. Despite its modest V-6 engine, the 296 GTB turns faster laps around Ferrari‚Äôs Fiorano test circuit than any V-8 model in company history. The Ferrari weighs in at 1,467 kilograms (3,234 pounds), unusually svelte for a hybrid, which aids its sharp handling. At the top of the hybrid food chain is Ferrari‚Äôs F80, a hypercar inspired by Formula 1 racers. It pairs a V-6 with five electric motors‚Äîtwo in turbochargers, three for propulsion‚Äîfor a total of 882 kW (1,200 horsepower). The two electric motors driving the front wheels allow for independent torque vectoring. Only 799 of the F80s will be built, but those numbers do not capture the cultural impact of harnessing hybrid tech in one of the world‚Äôs most exclusive sports cars. Porsche 911 GTS T-Hybrid: A First for Porsche The Porsche 911 now has its first electrified design. The new Porsche 911 GTS T-Hybrid keeps the model‚Äôs classic flat-six, rear-engine layout but adds a 40-kW electric motor, for a combined 391 kW (532 horsepower). Another 20-kW motor drives a single electric turbocharger, which has much less lag and wasted heat than mechanical turbochargers do. \n\nPorsche‚Äôs 911 GTS T-Hybrid is the carmaker‚Äôs first electric car offering.PorscheThe 911 GTS T-Hybrid‚Äôs 400-volt system quickly spools that turbo up to 120,000 rpm; peak turbo boost arrives in less than one second, versus more than three seconds before [[",

      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/switchbot-k20-pro-ces",
      "contentSnippet": "Earlier this year, we reviewed the SwitchBot S10, a vacuuming and wet mopping robot that uses a water-integrated docking system to autonomously manage both clean and dirty water for you. It‚Äôs a pretty clever solution, and we appreciated that SwitchBot was willing to try something a little different. At CES this week, SwitchBot introduced the K20+ Pro, a little autonomous vacuum that can integrate with a bunch of different accessories by pulling them around on a backpack cart of sorts. The K20+ Pro is SwitchBot‚Äôs latest effort to explore what‚Äôs possible with mobile home robots.\n\nSwitchBot‚Äôs small vacuum can transport different payloads on top.SwitchBotWhat we‚Äôre looking at here is a ‚Äúmini‚Äù robotic vacuum (it‚Äôs about 25 centimeters in diameter) that does everything a robotic vacuum does nowadays: It uses lidar to make a map of your house so that you can direct it where to go, it‚Äôs got a dock to empty itself and recharge, and so on. The mini robotic vacuum is attached to a wheeled platform that SwitchBot is calling a ‚ÄúFusionPlatform‚Äù that sits on top of the robot like a hat. The vacuum docks to this platform, and then the platform will go wherever the robot goes. This entire system (robot, dock, and platform) is the ‚ÄúK20+ Pro multitasking household robot.‚ÄùSwitchBot refers to the K20+ Pro as a ‚Äúsmart delivery assistant,‚Äù because you can put stuff on the FusionPlatform and the K20+ Pro will move that stuff around your house for you. This really doesn‚Äôt do it justice, though, because the platform is much more than just a passive mobile cart. It also can provide power to a bunch of different accessories, all of which benefit from autonomous mobility:\n\nThe SwitchBot can carry a variety of payloads, including custom payloads.SwitchBotFrom left to right, you‚Äôre looking at an air circulation fan, a tablet stand, a vacuum and charging dock and an air purifier and security camera (and a stick vacuum for some reason), and lastly just the air purifier and security setup. You can also add and remove different bits, like if you want the fan along with the security camera, just plop the security camera down on the platform base in front of the fan and you‚Äôre good to go.This basic concept is somewhat similar to Amazon‚Äôs Proteus robot, in the sense that you can have one smart powered base that moves around a bunch of less smart and unpowered payloads by driving underneath them and then carrying them around. But SwitchBot‚Äôs payloads aren‚Äôt just passive cargo, and the base can provide them with a useful amount of power.\n\nA power port allows you to develop your own payloads for the robot.SwitchBotSwitchBot is actively encouraging users to ‚Äúto create, adapt, and personalize the robot for a wide variety of innovative applications,‚Äù which may include ‚Äú3D-printed components [or] third-party devices with multiple power ports for speakers, car fridges, or even UV sterilization lamps,‚Äù according to the press release. The maximum payload is only 8 kilograms, though, so don‚Äôt get too crazy.\n\nSeveral SwitchBots can make bath time much more enjoyable.SwitchBotWhat we all want to know is when someone will put an arm on this thing, and SwitchBot is of course already working on this:\n\nSwitchBot‚Äôs mobile manipulator is still in the lab stage.SwitchBotThe arm is still ‚Äúin the lab stage,‚Äù SwichBot says, which I‚Äôm guessing means that the hardware is functional but that getting it to reliably do useful stuff with the arm is still a work in progress. But that‚Äôs okay‚Äîgetting an arm to reliably do useful stuff is a work in progress for all of robotics, pretty much. And if SwitchBot can manage to produce an affordable mobile manipulation platform for consumers that even sort of works, that‚Äôll be very impressive.",

But how do you make sure you don't drop those aspirations by February? Alex has some tips and tricks to get you focused for the year ahead - and ensure your dreams become reality. \n\nTips &amp; Tricks to Help You on Your 2025 Journey: \n\nBuild a system versus just setting goals. This will help you achieve your goals by creating a more sustainable system that fits with your lifestyle. For example, if you want to improve your coding skills, make a habit to set aside some time each day to work on it. Keep your habits low impact and realistic. As a plus, this will save you a LOT of stress.\nProcrastination is your biggest pitfall. We all fall into this trap but try your best to avoid it. Use lists, timeblocking, and have alternate projects you can lean on when you need to deviate from your scheduled tasks. You can also hit up the two-minute trick: If something just takes you only a few minutes to do, then do it. \nStart early! There is no better time than the present to start something new. If you don't feel up to something, tomorrow will likely be no different for you. Therefore, avoid putting things off as much as you can. \nSkip one day, but never more than that. Give yourself some grace, and if you need to let a day slide, that's okay. However, if you find yourself adding another day to your grace period, it's probable that you will only continue to add more days. This trick will help you save yourself from the &quot;habit graveyard&quot; (as Alex puts it).\n\nWhat tricks help you stay on track with your goals? Other members of the TCMS community would love to see what works for you! We will be sharing more goalsetting resources and career maps, so keep following us for some support on your 2025 journey! \n\n#goalsetting #goalsettingjourney #cybersecurity #goalsetting2025 #professionaldevelopment \n\nüì±Social Mediaüì±\n___________________________________________\nX: https://x.com/TCMSecurity\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/thecybermentor\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tcmsecurity/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/tcm-security-inc/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@tcmsecurity\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/tcm\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/tcmsecure\n\nüí∏Donateüí∏\n___________________________________________\nLike the channel?

      "contentSnippet": "It‚Äôs been more than a year since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new rules to enhance the annual reporting of cybersecurity measures practiced by SEC registrants. These requirements are in addition to those about the timely disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents that these companies experience. This tougher stance from the SEC has prompted executives and boards of directors to look at cybersecurity, not as an afterthought, but as a business-critical priority. The SEC‚Äôs new rules also hold these leaders and their companies legally accountable should they not follow the agency's cybersecurity rules ‚Äî putting chief information security officers in the hot seat.¬†In the first year of the program, more than 20 cybersecurity incidents were disclosed to the commission via corporations' filings of Form 8-K. Listed below in chronological order are those 22 filings, including details such as the filing date, the target of the incident, and the impact that the incident had on the business.While the SEC‚Äôs cybersecurity-incident disclosure rules are generally positive for the betterment of cybersecurity, readers who follow the links for each filing will see that the vast majority of these disclosures don‚Äôt yield much information beyond what we describe below. Details missing from the forms include the type of attack, the identity of the attack‚Äôs perpetrators, and how the perpetrators were able to breach the company‚Äôs systems in the first place. This is because the SEC‚Äôs rules for Form 8-K only ask registrants to disclose ‚ÄúThe material aspects of the nature, scope, and timing of the incident; and the material impact or reasonably likely material impact on the registrant, including on the registrant‚Äôs financial condition and results of operations.‚Äù¬†The commission also clearly stated in its announcement of the new rules last year that it doesn‚Äôt require registrants ‚Äúto disclose specific or technical information about its planned response to the incident or its cybersecurity systems, related networks and devices, or potential system vulnerabilities in such detail that would impede its response or remediation of the incident.‚ÄùWhat this means is that these 8-K disclosure rules do not provide the attack transparency that the cybersecurity community could use to bolster critical systems against similar incidents, bestowing instead only higher-level benefits to key market players, who will become more aware of registrants‚Äô cybersecurity practices, and to registrants, who hopefully will take their cybersecurity efforts more seriously.¬†Of course, some of the 8-K filings concern attacks previously reported in the media, and so we know something about the type of attack in those cases. Here are some of the trends that can be gleaned from that information.",

      "contentSnippet": "Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee has confirmed that cybercriminals are attempting to leak stolen data after gaining unauthorized access to the state's central platform for operating numerous health and human services divisions, including social benefits.¬†\nWHY IT MATTERS\nMcKee‚Äôs office said Monday that, according to its consultant Deloitte, the hackers who broke into the IT system for the state's health and benefits programs earlier this month have released a set of files on the dark web,¬†WPRI reported.\n\"Today the cyber criminals did in fact publish at least some of the Rhode Island Bridge's information and data files onto the dark web,\" McKee said during a press conference.\nIn a previous update on its website, the state said that Deloitte confirmed \"a high probability that a cybercriminal has obtained files with personally identifiable information.\"\nThe consultant is working with the state to generate the list of impacted individuals.¬†\n\"Once we have that information, we will send letters to those individuals with instructions on how to access free credit monitoring,\" the alert said.\nHealthSource RI, the state‚Äôs marketplace for affordable health coverage, is part of the Ocean State's Department of Administration RIBridges system and is temporarily unavailable due to the cyberattack announced on December 13.¬†\nAccording to the state website, the system that Deloitte manages is the main operations system for the state's management, including legal services, accounts and control, management and budget, purchasing, auditing, human resources, certain personnel services, capital asset management and maintenance, IT, energy resources and many internal services.\nThe state took the system offline after Deloitte discovered the network intrusion.¬†\nRIBridges also manages the state's Medicaid, SNAP and other social programs, many of which have switched to manual processes.¬†\nDue to the outage, HealthSource RI has extended open enrollment from Tuesday's deadline until February 28 via call center. Patients with plans that would not automatically renew for 2025 will now be extended until the system is restored and they can select new plans, according to the website alert.\nGovernment officials said they have identified about 650,000 people whose personal information ‚Äì including Social Security and bank account numbers ‚Äì was stolen from the system.\nDatabreaches.net reported Monday that it had made contact with Brain Cipher, and the ransomware group confirmed that they were responsible for the RIBridges attack and inspected the archive file with personal information provided by the threat actors.¬†\nReaching the threat actors‚Äô dark web leak site is challenging, however, according to the¬†story.¬†\nBrain Cipher told the publication that they have been under a denial of service attack to try and stop them from leaking the data.¬†\nTHE LARGER TREND\nState records systems that hold protected health information are targeted in cyberattacks and criminals have been known to¬†publish protected data.\nIn July, RansomHub began leaking Florida Department of Health employee records, prescription data, screening information, Social Security numbers and more on a Tor-based leak site. The group claimed to have stolen 100 gigabytes of data from the Sunshine State's public health network.\nHealthcare cybersecurity challenges outpace every other sector, according to an analysis of 2023 cyberattacks by SecurityScorecard, a supply chain cybersecurity firm.¬†\nThe sector also¬†leads in third-party data breaches, which snare providers, health plans, healthcare organizations and public health networks. Two years ago, a¬†ransomware attack on a federal vendor, Healthcare Management Solutions, had the potential to impact up to 254,000 Medicare beneficiaries.\nWhile the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said that the vendor acted in \"violation of its obligations,\" the federal agency is also under investigation by the U.S. Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights for a¬†cyber breach¬†that ultimately affected 3,112,815 individuals, reported in September.\nThe recent CMS data breach was one in a string related to a¬†vulnerability in the file transfer tool MOVEit.\nON THE RECORD\n\"Our top priority is exactly what we talked about ‚Äì informing people, getting the information out, having people protect their identity and also get those benefits out,\" McKee said in response to a question about the state's continued relationship with Deloitte at Monday's televised press conference. \"The issues that have to do with IT, we will take those issues one day at a time.\"\nAndrea Fox is senior editor of Healthcare IT News.\nEmail:¬†afox@himss.org\nHealthcare IT News is a HIMSS Media publication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Enterprise Taxonomy:¬†Health Information ExchangeCybersecurity and PrivacySecurityData and Information",

      "contentSnippet": "Ransomware attacks are having a severe impact on U.S. healthcare organizations, with an alarming escalation in incidents and their consequences, according to a Comparitech report.\nThe study found that since 2018, 654 ransomware attacks have targeted healthcare providers, with 2023 standing out as a record-breaking year, logging 143 incidents.\nThese attacks compromised over 88.7 million patient records during this period, with more than 26.2 million breached in 2023 alone.\nEach day of downtime due to ransomware costs healthcare organizations an average of $1.9 million, culminating in an estimated $21.9 billion in downtime losses over six years.\nOn average, medical organizations experienced 17 days of downtime per incident, with the highest disruptions reported in 2022, averaging 27 days.\nRebecca Moody, head of data research at Comparitech, noted the evolving nature of ransomware threats in healthcare.\n\"One of the most significant changes in ransomware attacks has been the increased focus on stealing large amounts of data,\" she said. \"If we look at the top 10 ransomware data breaches since 2018, seven of them occurred in 2023 and 2024.\"\nShe explained healthcare organizations are particularly vulnerable to ransomware attacks due to their reliance on operational continuity and sensitive patient data.\n\"Healthcare organizations can ill-afford downtime,\" Moody said. \"Losing access to systems can cause widespread chaos, delayed healthcare, and even errors in medication dispensing.\"\nShe said hackers often leverage this urgency, employing double-extortion tactics by encrypting systems while exfiltrating data to increase the pressure for ransom payments.\nMoody stressed that preparation is key to minimizing the impact of ransomware attacks.\n\"The key is being prepared for the worst-case scenario,\" she said. \"Having an incident response team, a communication plan, and clear instructions for managing threats and recovering data can help healthcare companies recover quickly.\"\nFrequent data backups are also essential to recovery efforts, but many organizations face challenges in implementing them due to budget constraints and gaps in employee training.\nAs ransomware tactics continue to evolve, Moody emphasized the importance of robust cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive patient data and maintain operational integrity.¬†\n\"Having a plan in place can help hospitals and clinics maintain continuity of care, even during prolonged system outages,\" she said.\nThe report comes as Nebraska's Attorney General filed a lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries Change Healthcare and Optum following a ransomware attack that disrupted critical healthcare services across the state.\nHealthcare organizations are still struggling to get a handle on cybersecurity as threats explode and complexity of defense increases, with the rise of AI also causing concern.\n\n\n\n\nNathan Eddy is a healthcare and technology freelancer based in Berlin.\nEmail the writer:¬†nathaneddy@gmail.com\nTwitter:¬†@dropdeaded209\n\n\n Enterprise Taxonomy:¬†",

This classic, yet often overlooked technique can allow attackers to remove cookies from a target user and replace them with their own‚Äîleading to serious security risks like account takeovers. When combined with vulnerabilities like session fixation, the impact can be devastating.\n\nüîç In this video, we‚Äôll cover:\n\n- The theory behind cookie jar behavior and browser quirks.\n- How attackers manipulate session cookies using this technique.\n- A live demo of Cookie Jar Overflow in action, set up in a controlled lab environment.\n\nKey Concepts Explained:\nBrowsers have cookie limits (e.g., ~160-165 cookies in Chrome/Firefox). By flooding the cookie jar, attackers can push out important cookies (like session cookies) and inject their own. If the web app doesn't validate cookies properly, the attacker gains control. This attack is even more dangerous when paired with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\nOther Use Cases:\nCookie Jar Overflow isn‚Äôt just about session fixation. It can also be used for:\n- Cache poisoning with malicious cache keys.\n- Manipulating application state via cookie-stored flags.\n\nDon't miss out on this critical insight into a technique that could bypass traditional security defenses!

      "contentSnippet": "Not having the right attorney for your\nparticular case is one of the most common mistakes people make when deciding on\nlegal representation. You might think you have a good understanding of what\nspecific factors you should evaluate when hiring an attorney.Unfortunately,\nmany times those factors are wrong can land you in a world of pain if you are\nlater found guilty. The following seven points are just a few things to\nconsider when choosing a criminal defense lawyer.What Is a Criminal Defense Lawyer?A criminal defense lawyer is a lawyer who helps\nyou defend yourself against criminal charges. They can help you navigate the\ncourt system and fight for your rights.Some courts have a limited number of¬†commercial real estate attorney¬†who can handle criminal cases, so it is important to research which courts have a greater number of available legal resources.There are a few things to consider when choosing\na criminal defense lawyer. First, it is important to find a lawyer who has\nexperience in your specific case. Second, it is important to find a lawyer who\nhas contacts in the court system. Finally, it is important to budget for the\nlegal fees associated with a criminal defense case. All these factors will\nimpact how successful you are in your defense.Legal Issues to Consider When Choosing Your\nAttorneyWhen you are facing criminal charges, it is\nimportant to choose the right lawyer, such as hiring the best\ncriminal attorneys in Gary, Indiana that handle a variety of criminal cases, If you have been charged\nwith a crime, you can contact them before you talk to the police or\nauthorities, as you always have the right to speak to an attorney.There are a number of legal issues to consider\nwhen choosing your lawyer, including:1. The type of charge you are facing. Charges\ncan range from misdemeanors to felonies. It is important to know the difference\nbetween the two so that you can choose the right lawyer for your case.2. The availability of lawyers in your area.\nSome courts have a limited number of attorneys who can handle criminal cases,\nso it is important to research which courts have a greater number of available\nlegal resources.3.The fees that your attorney will charge. There\nis no one-size-fits-all when it comes to lawyer fees; each case requires\ndifferent amounts of money and time commitment. It is important to get an\nestimate from your potential lawyer before making a decision.4. The experience and qualifications of your\nattorney. Many times, the more experience an attorney has, the less expensive\ntheir services will be. Should you also look for an attorney with\nqualifications in the area of law that you are facing?Questions To Ask Before Hiring An AttorneyBefore hiring an attorney, you should ask\nyourself a few questions. You should ask the lawyer if they have experience\nwith your specific case. You should also ask if they have any previous\nconvictions that could impact your case. You should also ask about their fees\nand how long they will take them to represent you.When it comes to choosing a criminal defense\nlawyer, it is important to ask yourself some questions. Here are a few to help\nyou get started:1. What is your experience with criminal law?2.How long have you been practicing law?3. What kinds of cases have you tried before?4. Do you have any personal experience with the\ncase I am facing?5. What is your fee structure?6. Will you represent me regardless of the\noutcome of the case?7. Is there anything else I should know about\nyour practice?Types of Emergencies Attorneys HandleWhen it comes to choosing a criminal defense\nlawyer, it is important to know the types of emergencies that attorneys handle.\nThere are several different types of emergencies that an attorney could be\ncalled to represent a client in.One type of emergency involves a crime that has\nalready been committed. If you have been accused of a crime and you need legal\nassistance right away, your attorney may be able to help you. An attorney can\nhelp you deal with the police and ensure that you have a fair trial.Another type of emergency involves something\nthat has happened while you are being detained or arrested. If you have been\narrested, your attorney can help you obtain bail or parole right away. Your\nattorney can also provide legal representation during your time in detention or\nprison.Lastly, if you are facing a serious charge and\ndo not have an attorney yet, your local Legal Aid Society may be able to\nprovide assistance. Legal Aid attorneys typically do not charge clients for\ntheir services, and they will work tirelessly to get your case resolved in your\nfavor.Choosing The Right Attorney Or FirmWhen it comes to choosing a criminal defense\nlawyer, it is important to do your research. The wrong lawyer can cost you\nvaluable legal time and money, so it is important to select the right one for\nyour case.The first step in choosing a criminal defense\nlawyer is to decide what type of lawyer you need. There are three main types of\nlawyers: criminal defense attorneys, civil defense attorneys, and bankruptcy\nattorneys.Criminal defense attorneys specialize in\ndefending people accused of crimes. They will work closely with you throughout\nthe entire legal process to ensure that you have the best chance of success in\ncourt.Civil defense attorneys represent people who\nhave been accused of a crime but have not yet been charged with a crime. They help\npeople prepare for potential court appearances and defend them against civil\nclaims such as slander or libel.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBankruptcy attorneys help individuals file for\nChapter 7 or Chapter 13 bankruptcy protection. This protection allows people to\nkeep most of their assets while they try to get their lives back on track.\nBankruptcy lawyers can also help you understand your options if you are\ncontemplating filing for bankruptcy.",

      "contentSnippet": "¬†The world of Dynamic Domain Name System (DynDNS) services is vast, and various providers offer unique features to cater to the specific needs of users. One such provider is \"Mysk2 DynDNS Org,\" a name that has started to gain traction for offering flexible and robust services in the realm of dynamic DNS. This article will delve into the specifics of Mysk2 DynDNS Org, explaining what it is, how it works, its features, and its importance in modern networking. Additionally, we will answer some frequently asked questions (FAQs) to provide further clarity on this service.What is Mysk2 DynDNS Org?Mysk2 DynDNS Org is a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service provider that allows users to assign domain names to dynamic IP addresses. This service is particularly beneficial for individuals or businesses that have internet connections with dynamic IPs but still want to access their devices or services remotely through a stable domain name.Typically, an internet connection uses a dynamic IP address, meaning it changes periodically. This can create challenges for users who need to access their home or office network remotely, as the IP address is not constant. Mysk2 DynDNS Org solves this issue by providing users with a static domain name that automatically updates when the dynamic IP changes.Key Features of Mysk2 DynDNS Org1. Automatic IP UpdatesThe primary benefit of using Mysk2 DynDNS Org is the automatic update of IP addresses. When your IP address changes, Mysk2 DynDNS Org will automatically detect the change and update your domain name accordingly. This ensures you can access your devices without manually tracking or updating IP addresses.2. Custom Domain SupportMysk2 DynDNS Org allows users to set up custom domain names, making it easier for people to remember and access their services. Whether it‚Äôs for a personal website, server, or home surveillance system, you can create a subdomain (e.g., myserver.mysk2.dyndns.org) or even point a custom domain to your dynamic IP.3. Easy ConfigurationSetting up Mysk2 DynDNS Org is straightforward. Users only need to create an account, configure the router or the device to update the IP, and then link the domain to their IP address. There are many tutorials and guides available to help users with the setup process.4. Security FeaturesSecurity is a critical concern when dealing with remote access. Mysk2 DynDNS Org integrates security protocols to ensure the integrity of your data. It supports encrypted connections and provides options for securing access to your network.5. Device CompatibilityMysk2 DynDNS Org supports a wide range of devices, including routers, IP cameras, and home servers. It integrates seamlessly with many third-party applications, providing maximum flexibility for users with diverse needs.6. Low LatencyMysk2 DynDNS Org offers low-latency connections for faster and more reliable access to your network. This is especially useful for applications such as remote desktop access, IP surveillance, and online gaming.7. Multiple SubdomainsFor users with multiple devices or services that require dynamic DNS, Mysk2 DynDNS Org allows the creation of multiple subdomains under a single account. This is useful for people who want to access various services through different domain names but manage them all from one central dashboard.8. Free and Paid PlansMysk2 DynDNS Org offers both free and premium subscription options. While the free version provides basic functionality, paid plans unlock additional features such as more subdomains, custom domains, and enhanced support.How Does Mysk2 DynDNS Org Work?Dynamic DNS works by associating a domain name with a dynamic IP address. This association is maintained by periodically updating the DNS records as the IP address changes. In the case of Mysk2 DynDNS Org, the following steps illustrate how the system works:1. Dynamic IP AddressWhen you sign up for an internet connection, you are typically assigned a dynamic IP address by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This IP address is not fixed and can change at any time, depending on your ISP's policy.2. Creating an Account on Mysk2 DynDNS OrgTo get started, you need to sign up for an account on Mysk2 DynDNS Org. Once registered, you will be able to create a unique subdomain (e.g., mydevice.mysk2.dyndns.org).3. Router or Device ConfigurationOnce your account is set up, you need to configure your router or device to automatically update the dynamic DNS service with the current IP address. Many modern routers have built-in support for DDNS services like Mysk2 DynDNS Org. For those that do not, software solutions or scripts can be used to handle the task.4. IP Address DetectionMysk2 DynDNS Org uses special software or router integration to monitor your IP address. When the IP address changes (usually due to a router reset, a lease expiry, or other factors), the service automatically detects the change and updates the DNS records to reflect the new address.5. Accessing Your NetworkWith the DNS records updated, you can now use your custom domain name to access your network services remotely. For example, if you set up a server at home, you can access it by typing \"mydevice.mysk2.dyndns.org\" into a web browser or remote access software, without needing to know your dynamic IP address.6. MaintenanceMysk2 DynDNS Org also offers periodic maintenance to ensure that the DNS records remain up-to-date. This service reduces the need for manual intervention, keeping things running smoothly even as your IP address changes.Why is Mysk2 DynDNS Org Important?1. Remote Access to DevicesOne of the primary reasons for using Mysk2 DynDNS Org is to enable remote access to devices.

By using this service, users can keep their server accessible through a consistent domain name.3. Cost-Effective SolutionFor small businesses or individuals who need a static IP address for their services but cannot afford the cost of a static IP from their ISP, Mysk2 DynDNS Org offers a low-cost solution. The free tier provides basic functionality, while the paid versions are still significantly cheaper than purchasing a dedicated static IP.4. Support for IoT DevicesWith the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, Mysk2 DynDNS Org plays a key role in allowing users to remotely access and control these devices. Whether it‚Äôs a smart home system or a security camera, Mysk2 helps provide access even when the underlying IP address changes.5.

Posted by James Forshaw, Google Project ZeroThis is a short blog post about some recent improvements I've been making to the OleView.NET¬†tool which has been released as part of version 1.16. The tool is designed to discover the attack surface of Windows COM and find security vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation and remote code execution. The updates were recently presented at the Microsoft Bluehat conference in Redmond under the name \"DCOM Research for Everyone!\". This blog expands on the topics discussed to give a bit more background and detail that couldn't be fit within the 45-minute timeslot. This post assumes a knowledge of COM as I'm only going to describe a limited number of terms.Using the OleView.NET¬†Tooling\n Before we start the discussion it's important to understand how you can get hold of the OleView.NET¬†tool and some basic usage. The simplest way to get the tooling is to install it from the PowerShell gallery with the Install-Module OleViewDotNet¬†command. This installs both the PowerShell module and the GUI. \n \n Next you need to parse the COM registration artifacts into an internal database. You can do this by running the Get-ComDatabase¬†command. Once it's finished you're ready to go. You will notice that it can take a long time to complete, so it'd be annoying to have to do this every time you want to start researching. For that reason you can use the command Set-ComDatabase -Default¬†to write out the database to a default storage location. Now the next time you start PowerShell you can just run an inspection command, such as Get-ComClass¬†and the default database will be automatically loaded. \n \n This default database is also shared with the GUI, which you can start by running the Show-ComDatabase¬†command. For general research I find the GUI to be easier to use and you can click around and look at the COM registration information. For analysis, the ability to script through PowerShell is more important.Researching COM Services\n Performing security research in COM usually involves the following steps::Enumerate potential COM classes of interest. These might be classes which are accessible outside of a sandbox, running at high privilege or designed to be remotely exposed.Validate whether the COM classes are truly accessible from the attack position. COM has various security controls which determine what users can launch, activate and access an object. Understanding these security controls allows the list of COM classes of interest to be limited to only those that are actually part of the attack surface.Enumerate exposed interfaces, determine what they do and call methods on them to test for security vulnerabilities.\n \n The last step is the focus of the updates to the tooling, making it easier to determine what an exposed interface does and call methods to test the behavior. The goal is to minimize the amount of reverse engineering needed (although generally some is still required) as well as avoid needing to write code outside of the tooling to interact with the COM service under test.\n \n To achieve this goal, OleView.NET¬†will pull together¬†any sources of interface information it has, then provide a mechanism to inspect and invoke methods on the interface through the UI or via PowerShell. The sources of information that it currently pulls together are:\n Known interfaces, either defined in the base .NET framework class libraries or inside OleView.NET.COM interface definitions present in the Global Assembly Cache.Registered type libraries.Windows Runtime interfaces.Extracted proxy class marshaling information.\n \n One useful benefit of gathering this information, is that the tool formats the interface as \"source code\" so you can manually inspect it.Formatting Interfaces Definitions\n The OleView.NET¬†tool uses a database object to represent all the artifacts it has analyzed on your system. The latest released version defines some of these objects to be convertible to \"source code\". For example the following can be converted if the tool can determine some meta data that to represent the artifact:COM interfacesCOM proxiesCOM Windows Runtime classes.Type libraries, interfaces and classes.\n \n How you get to this conversion depends on whether you're using the PowerShell or the UI. The simplest approach is PowerShell, using the ConvertTo-ComSourceCode¬†command. For example, the following will convert an interface object into source code:\n \n PS > Get-ComInterface -Name IMyInterface | ConvertTo-ComSourceCode -Parse\n \n Note that we also need to pass a -Parse¬†option to the command. Some metadata such as type libraries and proxies can be expensive to parse so it won't do that automatically. However, once they're been parsed in the current session the metadata is cached for further use, so for example if you formatted a single interface in a type library, all other interfaces are now also parsed and can be formatted.\n \n The output of this command is the converted \"source code\" as text. The format depends on metadata source. For example the following is the output from a Windows Runtime type:\n \n [Guid(\"155eb23b-242a-45e0-a2e9-3171fc6a7fdd\")]\n interface¬†IUserStatics\n {\n ¬† ¬† /* Methods */\n ¬† ¬† UserWatcher¬†CreateWatcher();\n ¬† ¬† IAsyncOperation¬†FindAllAsync();\n ¬† ¬† IAsyncOperation¬†FindAllAsync(UserType¬†type);\n ¬† ¬† IAsyncOperation¬†FindAllAsync(UserType¬†type,¬†\n ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†UserAuthenticationStatus¬†status);\n ¬† ¬† User¬†GetFromId(string¬†nonRoamableId);\n }\n \n As Windows Runtime types are defined using metadata similar to .NET then the output is a pseudo C# format. In contrast for type library or proxy it's look more like the following:\n \n [\n ¬† ¬† odl,\n ¬† ¬† uuid(00000512-0000-0010-8000-00AA006D2EA4),\n ¬† ¬† dual,\n ¬† ¬† oleautomation,\n ¬† ¬† nonextensible\n ]\n interface¬†_Collection¬†:¬†IDispatch¬†{\n ¬† ¬† [id(1),¬†propget]\n ¬† ¬† HRESULT¬†Count([out,¬†retval]¬†int*¬†c);\n ¬† ¬† [id(0xFFFFFFFC),¬†restricted]\n ¬† ¬† HRESULT¬†_NewEnum([out,¬†retval]¬†IUnknown**¬†ppvObject);\n ¬† ¬† [id(2)]\n ¬† ¬† HRESULT¬†Refresh();\n };\n \n This is in the Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL) format, the type library version should be pretty accurate and could even be recompiled by the MIDL compiler. For proxies some of the information is lost and so the MIDL generated isn't completely accurate, but as we'll see later there's limited reasons to take the output and recompile. \n \n Another thing to note is that proxies lose name information when compiled from MIDL to their C marshaled representation. Therefore the tool just generates placeholder names, for example, method names are of the form \"ProcN\". If the proxy is for a type that has a known definition, such as from a Windows Runtime type or a type library then the tool will try and automatically apply the names. If not, you'll need to manually change them if you want them to be anything other than the default.\n \n You can change the names from PowerShell by modifying the proxy object directly. For example the \"IBitsTest1\" interface looks like the following before doing anything:\n \n [\n ¬† object,\n ¬† uuid(51A183DB-67E0-4472-8602-3DBC730B7EF5),\n ]\n interface IBitsTest1 : IUnknown {\n ¬† ¬† HRESULT Proc3([out, string] wchar_t** p0);\n }\n \n You can modify \"Proc3\" with the following script:\n \n PS > $proxy¬†=¬†Get-ComProxy¬†-Iid¬†51A183DB-67E0-4472-8602-3DBC730B7EF5\n PS > $proxy.Procedures[0].Name = \"GetBitsDllPath\"\n PS > $proxy.Procedures[0].Parameters[0].Name = \"DllPath\"\n \n Now the formatted output looks like the following:\n \n [\n ¬† object,\n ¬† uuid(51A183DB-67E0-4472-8602-3DBC730B7EF5),\n ]\n interface¬†IBitsTest1¬†:¬†IUnknown¬†{\n ¬† ¬† HRESULT¬†GetBitsDllPath([out,¬†string]¬†wchar_t**¬†DllPath);\n }\n \n This renaming will also be important when we come back to calling proxied methods. Obviously it'd be annoying to run this script every time, so you can cache the names using the following command:\n PS > Export-ComProxyName -Proxy $p -ToCache\n \n This will write out a file describing the names to a local cache file. When the proxy is loaded again in another session this cache file will be automatically applied. The Export-ComProxyName¬†and corresponding Import-ComProxyName¬†commands allow you to read and write XML or JSON files representing the proxy names which you can modify in a text editor if that's easier.\n \n One of the quickest wins is to enumerate the interfaces for a COM object, then pass the output of that through the ConvertTo-ComSource¬†code command. For example:\n \n PS > $obj¬†=¬†New-ComObject¬†-Clsid¬†4575438f-a6c8-4976-b0fe-2f26b80d959e\n PS > Get-ComInterface -Object $obj | ConvertTo-ComSourceCode -Parse\n \n This creates a new COM object based on its CLSID, enumerates the interfaces it supports and then passes them through the conversion process to get out a \"source code\" representation of the interfaces.\n \n To view the source code in the GUI you first need to open one of the database views from the Registry¬†menu. In the resulting window, there will be a tree view of artifacts. You need to open the source code viewer window by right clicking the tree and selecting the Show Source Code¬†option in the context menu. This will result in a view similar to the following:\n \n \n \n You can also automatically enable the source code view from the View‚ÜíRegistry View Options¬†menu. In that menu you can also enable automatically parsing the interface information, which is off by default. \n \n You might notice in the screenshot that there's some text which is underlined. This indicates names which can be changed, and it is only used for proxies. You can right click the name and choose Edit Name¬†from the context menu to bring up a text entry dialog. You can then change the name to suit. If you want to persist the names between sessions then set the Save Proxy Names on Exit¬†option in the registry view options. Then when you exit any modified proxies will be written to the cache.\n \n If you want to edit a proxy from PowerShell in a similar GUI you can use following command:\n \n PS > Edit-ComSourceCode $proxy\n \n This will show a dialog similar to the following where you can do edits to the proxy name information:\n \n \n Genering Interfaces from a Proxy Definition\n \n Now on to the more important side of these updates, the ability to invoke methods on the interfaces exposed by an object you want to research. The tool has always given you some ability to invoke methods as long as the object has a .NET interface to call through reflection. This could either be through a known interface type, such as a built-in one or the Windows Runtime interfaces or by converting a type library into a .NET assembly on demand.\n \n What's new is the ability to generate an interface based on a proxy definition and then use that to invoke methods. Initially I tried to implement this by generating an .NET interface dynamically which would then use the existing .NET interop to call the proxy methods. This worked fine for simple proxies but quickly hit problems when doing anything more complex:Some types are hard to represent in easy to use .NET types, such as pointers to structures. This is \"handled\" in the type library converter by just exporting them as IntPtr¬†parameters which means the caller has to manually marshal the data. Get this wrong and the tool crashes.Any structures need to be accurately laid out so the native marshaler can read and write to the correct field locations. Get this wrong and the tool crashes.Did I mention that if you get this wrong the tool crashes?\n \n Fortunately I already had a solution, my sandbox library¬†already had the ability to dynamically generate a .NET class from parsed NDR data, in fact I was already using the library to parse the NDR data for proxies so I realized could I repurpose the existing client builder for COM proxy clients. I needed to do some simple refactoring of the code to make it build from a COM proxy instance rather than an RPC server, but I quickly had an RPC client. This RPC client doesn't directly interact with any native marshaling code, so it's unlikely to crash. Also any complex structures are built in a way which makes it easy to modify from .NET removing the problems around pointers. One issue with using the RPC client method is the same interface could be used for both in-process and out-of-process objects. Due to the way COM is designed a client usually doesn't need to care about where the object is, but in this case it must be accessible via a proxy. This isn't that big an issue, there's no security boundary between in-process COM objects and so being able to call methods on them isn't that interesting.\n \n The next problem was the RPC transport. COM calls have an additional input and output parameter, the ORPTHIS¬†and ORPCTHAT¬†structures, that need to be added to the call. These parameters could have been added to the RPC client, but it would seem best to make the clients agnostic of the transport. Instead as my RPC code has pluggable RPC transport I was able to reimplement a custom version over the top of the existing ALPC and TCP transports which added the additional parameters to any call. That wasn't the end of it though, ALPC needs an additional pair of parameters, LocalThis¬†and LocalThat, which are potentially different depending on versions of Windows. Also you need to add support for additional services such as the OXID resolver and communication with the local DCOM activator. While I implemented all this it wasn't as reliable as I'd like, however it's still present in the source code¬†if you want to play with it. \n \n As an aside, I should point out that Clement Rouault,¬†one of the original researchers into ALPC RPC protocol of which parts of my own implementation is inspired, recently released a very similar project¬†for their Python tooling which implements the ALPC DCOM protocol.\n \n I decided that I'd need a different approach, in the COM runtime the RPC channel used by a proxy instance is represented by the IRpcChannelBuffer¬†interface. An object implementing this interface is connected to the proxy during initialization, it is then used to send and receive NDR formatted data from the client to the server. The implementation handles all the idiosyncrasies such as the additional parameters, handling OXID resolving and reference counting. If we could get hold of a proxy object's instance of the IRpcChannelBuffer¬†object, we could use that instead of implementing our own protocol, the challenge was how to get it.\n \n After a bit of research I found that we can use the documented NdrProxyInitialize¬†function to get hold of the interface from its MIDL_STUB_MESSAGE¬†structure by passing in the interface pointer to a proxy. While it wouldn't be as flexible as a fully custom implementation this gave me an easy way to handle the transport without worrying about platform or protocol differences. It could also work from an existing COM object, just query the appropriate interface, extract the buffer and make calls to the remote server.\n \n Of course nothing is that simple, I discovered that while the IRpcChannelBuffer¬†object is a COM object it has a broken implementation of IMarshal. As .NET's COM interop tries to query for IMarshal¬†when generating a Runtime Callable Wrapper, it will immediately crash the process. I had to manually dispatch the calls¬†to the method through native delegates, but at least it works. \n Calling Interface Methods\n Okay, so how do you use the tool to call arbitrary methods? For the GUI it works like it always has, when you create an instance of a COM object, usually by right clicking an entry in a view and selecting Create Instance¬†you'll get a new object information window similar to the following:\n \n \n \n At the bottom of the window is a list of supported interfaces. In the right column is an indicator if there's a viewer for that interface. If it's set to Yes, then you can double click it to bring up an invocation window like the following:\n \n \n \n From this window you can double click a method to bring up a new dialog where you can specify the arguments and invoke the method as shown below.\n \n \n \n Once invoked it'll show the resulting output parameters and if the return value is an integer will assume it's a HRESULT error code. These windows are the same for \"reflected\" interfaces such as type libraries and Windows Runtime interfaces as well as proxy clients. The names of proxy methods won't be automatically updated if you change them when the interface window is open. You'll need to go back to the object information window and double click the interface again to get it to recreate the client.\n \n For PowerShell you can specify an Iid¬†argument when using the New-ComObject¬†command or use the Get-ComObjectInterface¬†command to query an existing COM object for a new interface. The tooling will pick the best option for calling the interface from the options available to it, including generating the RPC client dynamically. \n \n PS > $obj = New-ComObject -Clsid 4991D34B-80A1-4291-83B6-3328366B9097\n PS > $test = Get-ComObjectInterface $o -Iid 51A183DB-67E0-4472-8602-3DBC730B7EF5\n PS > $test.GetBitsDllPath()\n \n DllPath ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†retval\n ------- ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬†------\n c:windowssystem32qmgr.dll ¬† ¬† ¬†0\n \n To make it easier to call interface methods from PowerShell the exposed methods on the object will be modified to wrap output parameters in a single return value. You can see this in the listing above, the DllPath¬†parameter was originally an output only parameter. Rather than deal with ¬†that in the script a return structure was automatically created containing the DllPath¬†as well as the HRESULT return value. If the parameter is an input and output then the method signature accepts the input value and the return value contains the output value.\n \n If the definitions for your interface don't already exist you can import them into the tool to be used by the automatic interface selection. To do this you'll need to define the interfaces as .NET types and compile them into an assembly. Then in the GUI use the File‚ÜíImport Interop Assembly¬†menu option or for PowerShell use the Add-ComObjectInterface¬†command. Both of these options allow you to specify the assembly will be automatically loaded the next time you start the tool. This will make a copy of the DLL to a central location so that it can be accessed even if you delete the library later.\n \n If all you have is an IDL file for a set of COM interfaces you can import them into the tool indirectly with help from the Windows SDK. First compile the IDL file using the MIDL compiler to generate a type library, then use the TLBIMP¬†command to generate an Assembly file from the type library. Finally you can import it using the previous paragraph's methods.\n \n There's plenty to discover in OleView.NET¬†which I've not covered here. I'd encourage you to play around, or check out the source code¬†on github.",

      "contentSnippet": "TechHive opened for business in 2012 as a general consumer tech site. In 2017, we narrowed the focus to smart home and video streaming, responding to the hottest new developments in personal tech. It‚Äôs been a great run, but today we‚Äôre announcing that all new TechHive content will be published to sister site PCWorld on a just-launched TechHive section.\n\n\n\nWhy the change? First, we want TechHive content to reach as many people as possible, and PCWorld simply has a much larger audience of tech enthusiasts, DIYers, and early adopters. PCWorld launched as a computer magazine in 1983 and became a web domain in 1992. You just can‚Äôt beat this kind of institutional legacy, and we‚Äôre confident that TechHive will use its new platform to reach many more people interested in home technology.\n\n\n\nSecond, in recent years PCWorld has made a deliberate push to expand its digital security content. And as digital security blends ever more closely with physical security, it just makes sense to fold TechHive‚Äôs smart home security content into PCWorld‚Äôs security story. So, please check out the new TechHive landing page for articles on security cameras, video doorbells, smart locks, smart lighting and more.\n\n\n\nYou‚Äôll also find Jared Newman‚Äôs wildly popular Cord-Cutter Confidential column, along with other video streaming content that has helped define TechHive over the last seven years.\n\n\n\nThird, we‚Äôre relaunching the dormant TechHive YouTube channel! New videos have already gone live, and we‚Äôre planning for a steady stream of new product demos from CES 2025 in January.\n\n\n\nWe‚Äôll be covering products and categories familiar to TechHive readers, while also expanding into more lifestyle-oriented home tech, plus health and wellness tech. We think this broader video vision is a great match for PCWorld, which has been speaking to early adopters throughout its 40-plus years of publishing.\n\n\n\nSo, once again, I invite you to check out the new TechHive hub. We‚Äôve migrated much of TechHive security and streaming content to PCWorld already, and, going forward, all new TechHive content will appear on that page. Meanwhile, you can still access TechHive‚Äôs deep library of legacy content right here on this website.",

      "link": "https://www.techhive.com/article/579221/how-to-connect-a-soundbar-to-a-tv-without-hdmi-connectors.html",
      "contentSnippet": "While most modern soundbars rely on an HDMI cable to connect to HDTVs and 4K TVs, there are still plenty of soundbars on the market with legacy audio inputs that will work with older TVs‚Äîand yes, that includes many CRT (aka ‚Äútube‚Äù) TVs that are decades old.\n\n\n\nBy connecting an aging TV to a soundbar, you can give your older set a massive audio boost, complete with thumping bass and even virtualized 3D sound. And if your ancient flat-screen or tube TV has the right outputs, hooking it up to a new soundbar will be a snap.\n\n\n\nHere‚Äôs how to get started.\n\n\n\n1. Look for optical or RCA audio outputs\n\n\n\nThe first step is to check the back of your old TV to see what kind of audio outputs are available. If your aging TV lacks HDMI, the next best thing would be an optical (or Toslink) audio port, which has a squarish opening with a pair of small notches on each side. \n\n\n\nNot only can optical audio connections handle compressed (but not lossless) 5.1- and even 7.1-channel Dolby Digital and DTS sound, they‚Äôre also widely supported by the latest soundbars.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMany older TVs have at least analog stereo RCA audio outputs or even a multi-channel optical digital audio output.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo sign of an optical output? Then look for a stereo pair of RCA audio outputs, one for the left channel (commonly white and marked ‚ÄúL‚Äù) and a second for the right channel (commonly red and marked ‚ÄúR‚Äù). \n\n\n\nMany older TVs‚Äîeven those as far back as the 1980s‚Äîwill have these familiar-looking RCA plugs situated on their rear input/output panels, which can deliver analog stereo audio signals.\n\n\n\n2. Pick the right soundbar\n\n\n\nOnce you‚Äôve determined that your older TV has either optical or RCA analog audio outputs, you‚Äôre ready to go soundbar shopping‚Äîand, if we may be so bold, your first stop should be our roundup of the best soundbars, where we have reviews of the best soundbars at various price levels.\n\n\n\nAs you‚Äôre shopping, keep an eye out for soundbars that have audio inputs that match your TV‚Äôs outputs. If your set has an optical audio output, good news: soundbars with optical inputs are (as we mentioned earlier) easy to find. That said, there are more and more soundbars (particularly newer ones) that have only HDMI ports, so be sure to look carefully.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nYou‚Äôll find plenty of soundbars on the market with optical and 3.5mm analog audio inputs that will work with older TVs.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou‚Äôll see fewer current soundbars with an analog audio inputs than with optical connectors, but they‚Äôre still reasonably easy to find, particularly when it comes to budget soundbars in the sub-$200 range. \n\n\n\nWhat you‚Äôre looking for is a 3.5mm audio jack (generally labeled ‚ÄúAUX In‚Äù)¬†that connects to the twin RCA connectors on your TV via a Y-shaped adapter cable (read on for help with picking the right cables).\n\n\n\n\nRelated: 10 things to consider when shopping for a soundbar\n\n\n\n\n3. Look for virtualized 3D sound modes\n\n\n\nBesides having the right connectors, you should also consider a soundbar with a virtual surround or 3D mode. Many of the latest soundbars have become remarkably adept at teasing surround and 3D audio‚Äìcomplete with height effects‚Äìout of 5.1- or even 2.0-channel audio sources. \n\n\n\nIn particular, DTS Virtual:X is impressively effective at tricking your ears into thinking they‚Äôre hearing sound from behind and even above your head, even when the original audio is only in stereo (which will be the case if your TV only has RCA-style analog audio outputs). And here‚Äôs the really good news: you can find DTS Virtual:X processing in soundbars that cost well south of $200.\n\n\n\n\nRelated: How virtual 3D audio is amping up the the latest soundbars\n\n\n\n\n4. Use the correct optical or 3.5mm-to-RCA cables\n\n\n\nOnce you‚Äôve matched the optical and/or RCA-style audio outputs on your TV to the matching inputs on a soundbar, all you need to do is connect them using the proper cables. Most soundbar manufactures will include the proper optical cables (the ones that come with soundbars are generally quite short and thin) and RCA-to-3.5mm Y-cables.\n\n\n\nNo cables in the box? Don‚Äôt fret; both optical audio cables and RCA-to-3.5mm Y-cables are readily available through Amazon and other online retailers. Expect to spend about $15 or so for an optical cable, while RCA-to-3.5mm cables can be scooped up for less than $10.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOptical audio cables and RCA-to-3.5mm Y-cables (pictured) are readily available on Amazon, typically for less than $10 each.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Tweak your TV‚Äôs audio output settings\n\n\n\nYou might also need to make some adjustments to your TV‚Äôs audio settings. While some TVs may pipe sound through their audio-out ports automatically, others may require you to tinker with their audio settings Just start digging around in the TV‚Äôs settings menu.\n\n\n\nYou should also keep an eye out for a setting that switches your TV from ‚Äúfixed‚Äù audio output (which will allow the soundbar to control the volume) to ‚Äúvariable‚Äù output (where the TV controls the volume). If the option exists, consider going for the ‚Äúvariable‚Äù setting, which means you won‚Äôt need to switch back and forth between your soundbar and TV remotes each time you want to adjust the volume.\n\n\n\nReady to shop for soundbars?

      "link": "https://www.techhive.com/article/582313/how-to-get-rid-of-hum-and-eliminate-other-noises-from-your-audio-and-video-systems.html",
      "contentSnippet": "So you just unboxed your new entertainment gear, hooked everything up, and you hear buzz, whine, hiss, chatter, or any number of other annoying noises that have been known to plague audio equipment. You might even see some banding or waves on your TV. So you take it all back to the store, only to watch the salesperson plug it in and have everything work perfectly. What‚Äôs going on here?\n\n\n\nYou might just need a simple ground loop isolator, like the $16 TII Network Technologies TII 220. Or if audible hum is your problem, the $80 EBTech Hum X will filter out the voltage in your ground line that‚Äôs causing it. Troubled by noise on your TV? An inexpensive ($10) Monoprice HDMI cable with a ferrite bead might do the trick. Yet another strategy is to plug all your gear into a line interactive uninterruptible power supply (UPS), such as the $250 Cyberpower CP1500PFCLCD. \n\n\nEliminate hum with the $80 EBTech HUM X\n\n\nOr you can bring out the big guns and power everything with a high-end isolation transformer. If a device like the $510 Tripplite IS1000HG¬†can be trusted to protect and clean up the electricity feeding hospital equipment, it should be good enough for your home theater gear. \n\n\n\nThe problem could be bad wiring, defective equipment, or just a noisy electronic environment. Whatever the type of noise you‚Äôre hearing‚Äîand whatever the cause‚Äîwe‚Äôll help you identify it‚Äìand then show you how to get rid of it.\n\n\n\nCommon problem 1: Ground loops\n\n\n\nGround loops are the number-one cause of unusual audio noise and weird video, simply because it‚Äôs so darned easy to create. The most common manifestations are a loud buzz or hum coming through the speakers, or scrolling bands on a TV screen. It could also be a much quieter, yet equally annoying buzz or hum that you only hear when the room is otherwise quiet.\n\n\n\nA ground loop typically occurs when one or more pieces of your entertainment system are plugged into your home‚Äôs AC (alternating current) supply at different locations, and then connected together by electrical (versus optical) signal cables. RCA, HDMI, composite, component, and similar cables have shielding that‚Äôs connected to your home‚Äôs ground line. In the simplest terms, this creates a single-loop antenna that just loves to suck in various types of noise via electromagnetic induction. The illustration below shows how a ground loop can be created:\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tWhen you power inter-connected equipment from different AC outlets, you‚Äôre apt to create a ground loop: The ground will travel through the shielding of the signal cables.\n\n\n\n\nAnything that breaks the loop will remove the noise, and the easiest way to do it is to power everything through a single AC socket. As shown below, simply plug all your equipment into a single power strip, surge protector, or power center and plug that¬† into the wall. Problem solved. Most multimedia setups can be handled easily by a single 15-amp circuit.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tPowering connected equipment from the same AC socket will eliminate most ground loops. If you still get hum, see if your antenna or cable wire has its own ground connection.\n\n\n\n\nThere might be occasions where you simply can‚Äôt reach the same outlet with a piece of equipment. Self-powered speakers and subwoofers come to mind. You could just ‚Äúpull the ground‚Äù by using a three-prong to two-prong adapter but this represents a potential shock hazard. Look up Les Harvey and Stone the Crows for an extreme example of what can happen with high-powered equipment.\n\n\nResolve coax cable ground loops with the $16 TII Network Technologies' TII 220\n\n\nIf an extension cord is impractical, a hum eliminator such as Ebtech‚Äôs Hum X should do the trick, and there are other products that do roughly the same thing, some of which interrupt the loop in the signal cables. If you have the skills, you can build your own hum eliminator for about $10 or $15. You‚Äôll find plenty of information online that will show you how, but the task requires moderate skill with a soldering iron and similar tools.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEbtech‚Äôs Hum X eliminates ground loop noise safely. There are also DIY solutions online that are less expensive if you have the skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf those methods don‚Äôt fix things, the problem could be an over-the-air (OTA) antenna or a cable-TV coax cable that has its own path to ground. I‚Äôve received some pretty annoying shocks when handling coax signal splitters. Normally‚Äîbecause of the isolation built into cable modems, cable boxes, and similar equipment‚Äîthis will occur only if you‚Äôre connecting directly to the TV or to a video recorder.\n\n\n\nIf you‚Äôve traced the problem to the TV signal wire that‚Äôs attached to a cable modem or similar (disconnect it and see if the problem goes away)¬†replace that piece of equipment‚Äîthere‚Äôs something wrong with it. If you‚Äôre connecting directly to a TV, there are ground-loop isolators available for less than $20.\n\n\n\nCommon problem 2: AC line noise\n\n\n\nGround loops are hardly the only thing that cause electrical noise; pretty much any device with a motor (hair dryers and blenders, for instance), as well as dimmer switches and failing fluorescent fixtures will create this type of interference. It might be audible through your audio equipment or visible on your TV, or it might not. The obvious solution for this type of noise is to not use those types of devices while you‚Äôre watching TV or listening to music. You might be able to make that work‚Äîif you live alone. If there are other people under the same roof, perhaps not.¬†\n\n\nGet pristine AC power with a Tripp Lite SU1000XLCD UPS\n\n\nIf you‚Äôre willing to part with a few Benjamins, you can assure yourself of pristine AC without ground-loop noise by using a line interactive UPS (uninterruptible power supply) or an isolation transformer. A line interactive UPS is a battery-backup system with a battery that‚Äôs always engaged between the input AC and the output AC. This requires the electrical power to go through a conversion to DC (direct current) and then back to AC, which will remove all the noise. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tThis type of ground loop isolator, for coaxial cables used with over-the-air antennas and cable- and satellite-TV equipment, can eliminate both visual and audible noise.Amazon\n\n\n\nLine interactive UPSes are more expensive than the standby alternative, which keep switch to battery power on demand. Tripp Lite sent me its model SU1000XLCD UPS to clean up the super-dirty AC in my apartment. That device was selling for nearly $900 when I updated this article. It‚Äôs also heavy, about the size of a small dehumidifier, and it has some features (such as USB monitoring, so that it can gracefully shut down an attached computer in the event of a power failure) that have nothing to do with noise elimination. But darn if it isn‚Äôt 100 percent effective at providing protection against power surges and outages. The Tripp Lite IS1000HG isolation transformer I mentioned earlier will also clean up AC line noise. It costs several hundred dollars less, but doesn‚Äôt provide battery backup power.\n\n\nCondition your power with the Tripp Lite IS1000HG isolation transformer\n\n\nIt‚Äôs also much less-expensive than one of those high-end power conditioners you see marketed to gullible audiophiles. If you‚Äôre not worried about defeating ground-loop noise, you can get away for not much more than $100 with a UPS that advertises pure sine wave output.\n\n\n\nSlightly cheaper than an online UPS, but absolutely effective against all kinds of line noise is an isolation transformer. Tripplite sent me one of these as well: the excellent 1000-watt IS1000HG (Hospital Grade) with four outlets. It‚Äôs about $500, but you can easily get away with a lower wattage (500 or 250) model for less than $250. Note that I‚Äôve seen much cheaper on Amazon, but not from a known vendor, so I can‚Äôt vouch for them.\n\n\n\nAn isolation transformer is one of those products whose name describes it to a tee‚Äîit employs a special, shielded transformer that turns dirty AC into clean AC via electromagnetic induction‚Äîyes, the same thing that causes ground-loop noise.\n\n\n\nIsolation transformers are designed for use with delicate diagnostic equipment, where even minimally noisy AC can cause spurious readings. That means they‚Äôre substantially more than adequate for multimedia setups.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tThe hospital-grade Tripp Lite IS1000HG isolation transformer is designed to eliminate any AC noise that could affect sensitive test equipment. Good enough for hospitals, good enough for your home theater.Tripp Lite\n\n\n\nCommon noise problem 3: Wires and cables\n\n\n\nThere are really only one or two hard and fast rules for cables and noise. The first is to never run a power cable across or near audio or video signal cables, including antenna wires. Modern signal cables are well shielded, but if you‚Äôre getting hum and it‚Äôs not a ground loop, this could well be the cause. Note that the cables running from a source device to self-powered speakers (i.e., not Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) are audio signal cables, not output cables.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tHDMI cables with ferrite beads filter the electronic signals traveling over the cable to block spurious current traveling through the cable‚Äôs shielding.Monoprice\n\n\n\nBalanced audio cables, meanwhile, consist of three wires: Two wires are used carry the signal instead of one, but the polarity of that signal is reversed on one wire. The third wire is used for grounding. This design renders balanced cables far less susceptible to power-cable hum and other electrical noises. If your equipment provides the option of using balanced cables‚Äìwhether they be XLR or TRS (Tip/Ring/Sleeve)‚Äìtake advantage of it.\n\n\n\nSpeaker cables have far stronger signals traveling along them, so they shouldn‚Äôt be as affected by RFI. But just to be safe, try to keep your AC cords isolated.\n\n\nKill HDMI noise with a $10 Monoprice cable with a ferrite bead\n\n\nThe other rule for wires is not looping antenna signal cables (twin-lead), which tends to induce the same noise by making them antennas themselves. Electromagnetic induction; it‚Äôs a blessing, it‚Äôs a curse (if you don‚Äôt know about it).\n\n\n\nAs to the quality of cables: A poorly made cable can cause noise issues, but there‚Äôs no real advantage to spending a fortune on them. A common misconception is that the more expensive the metal, the better the cable. Wrong. Gold is used on connectors because it doesn‚Äôt oxidize, not because it‚Äôs the best conductor of electricity. It‚Äôs quite good, better than nickel or chrome, but actually a bit worse than silver and copper. Forget platinum‚Äîit sounds sexy, but is about 20th down the conductivity list.\n\n\n\nCopper wire with gold connectors are the best combination; but again, don‚Äôt listen to the boutique audio sales propaganda. There are plenty of cables in the $10 to $20 range‚Äîor even lower‚Äîthat will serve just as well.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tA line interactive uninterruptible power supply, like this CyberPower CP1500PFCLCD, continuously converts AC (alternating current) electrical power to DC (direct current) and then back to AC, removing all electrical noise in the process.Cyberpower\n\n\n\nOne thing you could check for, though it‚Äôs mostly an issue in high-impedance (higher gain/voltage, aka Hi-Z) applications, such as with guitar cables, is that they aren‚Äôt microphonic. Poor or loose shielding and other factors can actually turn physical shocks into audio signal. I‚Äôm not kidding. I‚Äôve experienced this only once in my life with component-connecting cables and that was for a turntable. But if you‚Äôre noticing odd noises that seem to be in time with the bass or vibrations, give the signal cables a hard tap with a finger (with the equipment powered on) to see if this is a problem.\n\n\n\nOne more wire issue: size. While larger gauge wire can actually help an amp work a little easier and cooler when driving speakers by lowering cable impedance (resistivity), the impact on signal cables is negligible. That is, it‚Äôs inaudible to anyone who didn‚Äôt pay a lot for a fat wire and needs to hear a difference.\n\n\n\nCommon noise problem 4: RF interference\n\n\n\nEver wonder why the walls of your stereo receiver and other electronic devices are metal, when it seems like everything else in the world is made of plastic? It‚Äôs not for tensile strength, it‚Äôs to block incoming and outgoing RFI (radio frequency interference). Any conductive material tends to block RF signals and shunt their charge to its surface. Indeed, the shielding on cables works as a Faraday cage.\n\n\n\nSince it wouldn‚Äôt be practical to turn your home theater into Faraday cage, you should instead look to lessen the strength of the radio signals your A/V gear needs protection from. I‚Äôm talking portable phones, cell phones, Wi-Fi equipment, and even computers.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tThe red box in this photo identifies the balanced audio inputs on the back of a Yamaha HS-7 speaker. Many high-end DACs and audio interfaces have corresponding outputs. Balanced connections eliminate any noise induced into the signal traveling the cable.Yamaha\n\n\n\nComputers can generate a lot of RFI, which is why I shy away from cases with see-through plastic sides, which allow RFI to travel both ways. Wireless computer peripherals, such as mice and keyboards, can also cause interference. But if that happens, it‚Äôs a malfunction or bad design and the only fix is to replace them.\n\n\n\nBack to the point: Don‚Äôt be paranoid, but it‚Äôs not a bad idea to keep your RFI-emitting equipment as far away from your multimedia setup as you can. And if it‚Äôs a device that‚Äôs meant to be near your setup, make sure it‚Äôs adequately shielded.\n\n\n\nCommon noise problem 5: USB/HDMI cable noise\n\n\n\nI use external USB and Thunderbolt audio interfaces because they sound a lot better than anything you‚Äôll find on a PC motherboard. Believe me: if my old ears can hear the difference, there is one. But when I first started using such gear, I would occasionally hear very faint static. For rather complicated reasons, current can leak into the shielding of USB cables which affects the signal. It‚Äôs annoying.\n\n\n\nThere are three methods for removing USB (and HDMI) cable noise. One is to use a¬†cable with a ferrite noise suppressor sleeve (a slug of iron molded around the cable). You can also buy clip-on ferrite noise suppressors. These are sometimes called a ferrite bead.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tYou can modify your own audio and video cables to render them more noise proof by adding ferrite beads. This 10-pack costs about $13 at Amazon.VSKEY\n\n\n\nThe second method is to run a wire that‚Äôs less resistive than the USB/HDMI cable shielding from the case of the USB audio interface or HDMI audio component to your computer‚Äôs case. Speaker wire works fine for this. Electricity always follows the path of least resistance, so spurious current runs down the ground wire rather than the cable‚Äôs shield. This is also known as a ground shunt, or simply a shunt.\n\n\n\nThe third method is to get a USB noise filter (I‚Äôve never seen one for HDMI, but an HDMI adapter could work), which is actually a USB re-transmitter that splits the shield connection. These cost around $50 and are said to indeed eliminate the noise. I‚Äôve never used one, because the first and second methods are far cheaper and have never failed me.\n\n\nKill cable noise by attaching ferrite beads\n\n\nCommon noise problem 6: PC audio noise\n\n\n\nThe other reason I use external USB and Thunderbolt interfaces is that they simply aren‚Äôt subjected to as much RFI. Internal audio solutions, especially those that reside on a computer‚Äôs motherboard, are susceptible to all sorts of line noise and electromagnetic interference that can‚Äôt be eliminated. As you might have noticed, I just gave you the solution‚Äîgo external USB or Thunderbolt. That said, there are PCI and PCIe cards that might also eliminate the problem, as well provide more outputs for gaming and surround.\n\n\n\nThe only good noise is the joyful noise you make\n\n\n\nAny combination of the approaches shown above should eliminate all the noise that‚Äôs not inherent in your audio system, as well as some you might have thought was inherent. But if you‚Äôre suffering a type of noise that I haven‚Äôt covered, or have a home-brew fix that works, please share it with us by leaving a comment on our Facebook page¬†and/or emailing me at letters@techhive.com.\n\n\nSign up for the weekly Best of TechHive newsletter",

      "contentSnippet": "Posted by Greg Mucci, Product Manager, Artifact Analysis, Oliver Chang, Senior Staff Engineering, OSV, and Charl de Nysschen, Product Manager OSVDevOps teams dedicated to securing their supply chain and predicting potential risks consistently face novel threats. Fortunately, they can now improve their image and container security by harnessing Google-grade vulnerability scanning, which offers expanded open-source coverage. A significant benefit of utilizing Google Cloud Platform is its integrated security tools, including Artifact Analysis. This scanning service leverages the same infrastructure that Google depends on to monitor vulnerabilities within its internal systems and software supply chains.Artifact Analysis has recently expanded its scanning coverage to eight additional language packages, four operating systems, and two extensively utilized base images, making it a more robust and versatile tool than ever before. ¬†¬†This enhanced coverage was achieved by integrating Artifact Analysis with the Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) platform and database. This integration provides industry-leading insights into open source vulnerabilities‚Äîa crucial capability as software supply chain attacks continue to grow in frequency and complexity, impacting organizations reliant on open source software.With these recent updates, customers can now successfully scan the vast majority of the images they push to Artifact Registry. These successful scans ensure that any known vulnerabilities are detected, reported, and can be integrated into a broader vulnerability management program, allowing teams to take prompt action.Open source vulnerabilities, with more reach¬†Artifact Analysis pulls vulnerability information directly from OSV, which is the only open source, distributed vulnerability database that gets information directly from open source practitioners. OSV‚Äôs database provides a consistent, high quality, high fidelity database of vulnerabilities from authoritative sources who have adopted the OSV schema. This ensures the database has accurate information to reliably match software dependencies to known vulnerabilities‚Äîpreviously a difficult process reliant on inaccurate mechanisms such as CPEs (Common Platform Enumerations).¬†Over the past three years, OSV has increased its total coverage to 28 language and OS ecosystems. For example, industry leaders such as GitHub, Chainguard, and Ubuntu, as well as open source ecosystems such as Rust and Python are now exporting their vulnerability discoveries in the OSV Schema. This increased coverage also includes Chainguard‚Äôs Wolfi images and Google‚Äôs Distroless images, which are popular choices for minimal container images used by many developers and organizations. Customers who rely on distroless images can count on Artifact Analysis scanning to support their minimal container image initiatives.¬† Each expansion in OSV‚Äôs coverage is incorporated into scanning tools that integrate with the OSV database.Broader vulnerability detection with Artifact Analysis¬†As a result of OSV‚Äôs expansion, scanners like Artifact Analysis that draw from OSV now alert users to higher quality vulnerability information across a broader set of ecosystems‚Äîmeaning GCP project owners will be made aware of a more complete set of vulnerability findings and potential security risks.¬†Existing Artifact Registry scanning customers don't need to take any action to take advantage of this update. Projects that have scanning enabled will immediately benefit from this expanded coverage and vulnerability findings will continue to be available in the Artifact Registry UI, Container Analysis API, and via pub/sub (for workflows).Existing On Demand scanning customers will also benefit from this expanded vulnerability coverage. All the same Operating Systems and Language package coverage that Registry Scanning customers enjoy are available in On Demand Scan.¬†Beyond Artifact Registry¬†We know that detection is just one of the first steps necessary to manage risks. We‚Äôre continually expanding Artifact Analysis capabilities and in 2025 we‚Äôll be integrating Artifact Registry vulnerability findings with Google Cloud‚Äôs Security Command Center. Through Security Command Center customers can maintain a more comprehensive vulnerability management program, and prioritize risk across a number of different dimensions.¬†",

      "title": "Announcing the launch of Vanir: Open-source Security Patch Validation",
      "link": "http://security.googleblog.com/2024/12/announcing-launch-of-vanir-open-source.html",
      "contentSnippet": "Posted by Hyunwook Baek, Duy Truong, Justin Dunlap and Lauren Stan from Android Security and Privacy, and Oliver Chang with the Google Open Source Security TeamToday, we are announcing the availability of Vanir, a new open-source security patch validation tool. Introduced at Android Bootcamp in April, Vanir gives Android platform developers the power to quickly and efficiently scan their custom platform code for missing security patches and identify applicable available patches. Vanir significantly accelerates patch validation by automating this process, allowing OEMs to ensure devices are protected with critical security updates much faster than traditional methods. This strengthens the security of the Android ecosystem, helping to keep Android users around the world safe.¬†By open-sourcing Vanir, we aim to empower the broader security community to contribute to and benefit from this tool, enabling wider adoption and ultimately improving security across various ecosystems. While initially designed for Android, Vanir can be easily adapted to other ecosystems with relatively small modifications, making it a versatile tool for enhancing software security across the board. In collaboration with the Google Open Source Security Team, we have incorporated feedback from our early adopters to improve Vanir and make it more useful for security professionals. This tool is now available for you to start developing on top of, and integrating into, your systems.The Android ecosystem relies on a multi-stage process for vulnerability mitigation. When a new vulnerability is discovered, upstream AOSP developers create and release upstream patches. The downstream device and chip manufacturers then assess the impact on their specific devices and backport the necessary fixes. This process, while effective, can present scalability challenges, especially for manufacturers managing a diverse range of devices and old models with complex update histories. Managing patch coverage across diverse and customized devices often requires considerable effort due to the manual nature of backporting.To streamline the vital security workflow, we developed Vanir. Vanir provides a scalable and sustainable solution for security patch adoption and validation, helping to ensure Android devices receive timely protection against potential threats.The power of VanirSource-code-based static analysis¬†Vanir‚Äôs first-of-its-kind approach to Android security patch validation uses source-code-based static analysis to directly compare the target source code against known vulnerable code patterns. Vanir does not rely on traditional metadata-based validation mechanisms, such as version numbers, repository history and build configs, which can be prone to errors. This unique approach enables Vanir to analyze entire codebases with full history, individual files, or even partial code snippets.¬†A main focus of Vanir is to automate the time consuming and costly process of identifying missing security patches in the open source software ecosystem. During the early development of Vanir, it became clear that manually identifying a high-volume of missing patches is not only labor intensive but also can leave user devices inadvertently exposed to known vulnerabilities for a period of time. To address this, Vanir utilizes novel automatic signature refinement techniques and multiple pattern analysis algorithms, inspired by the vulnerable code clone detection algorithms proposed by Jang et al. [1] and Kim et al. [2]. These algorithms have low false-alarm rates and can effectively handle broad classes of code changes that might appear in code patch processes. In fact, based on our 2-year operation of Vanir, only 2.72% of signatures triggered¬† false alarms. This allows Vanir to efficiently find missing patches, even with code changes, while minimizing unnecessary alerts and manual review efforts.¬†Vanir's source-code-based approach also enables rapid scaling across any ecosystem. It can generate signatures for any source files written in supported languages. Vanir's signature generator automatically generates, tests, and refines these signatures, allowing users to quickly create signatures for new vulnerabilities in any ecosystem simply by providing source files with security patches.¬†Android‚Äôs successful use of Vanir highlights its efficiency compared to traditional patch verification methods. A single engineer used Vanir to generate signatures for over 150 vulnerabilities and verify missing security patches across its downstream branches ‚Äì all within just five days.Vanir for AndroidCurrently Vanir supports C/C++ and Java targets and covers 95% of Android kernel and userspace CVEs with public security patches. Google Android Security team consistently incorporates the latest CVEs into Vanir‚Äôs coverage to provide a complete picture of the Android ecosystem‚Äôs patch adoption risk profile.¬†The Vanir signatures for Android vulnerabilities are published through the Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) database. This allows Vanir users to seamlessly protect their codebases against latest Android vulnerabilities without any additional updates. Currently, there are over 2,000 Android vulnerabilities in OSV, and finishing scanning an entire Android source tree can take 10-20 minutes with a modern PC.Flexible integration, adoption and expansion.Vanir is developed not only as a standalone application but also as a Python library. Users who want to integrate automated patch verification processes with their continuous build or test chain may easily achieve it by wiring their build integration tool with Vanir scanner libraries. For instance, Vanir is integrated with a continuous testing pipeline in Google, ensuring all security patches are adopted in ever-evolving Android codebase and their first-party downstream branches.Vanir is also fully open-sourced, and under BSD-3 license. As Vanir is not fundamentally limited to the Android ecosystem, you may easily adopt Vanir for the ecosystem that you want to protect by making relatively small modifications in Vanir. In addition, since Vanir‚Äôs underlying algorithm is not limited to security patch validation, you may modify the source and use it for different purposes such as licensed code detection or code clone detection. The Android Security team welcomes your contributions to Vanir for any direction that may expand its capability and scope. You can also contribute to Vanir by providing vulnerability data with Vanir signatures to OSV.Vanir ResultsSince early last year, we have partnered with several Android OEMs to test the tool‚Äôs effectiveness. Internally we have been able to integrate the tool into our build system continuously testing against over 1,300 vulnerabilities. Currently Vanir covers 95% of all Android, Wear, and Pixel vulnerabilities with public fixes across Android Kernel and Userspace. It has a 97% accuracy rate, which has saved our internal teams over 500 hours to date in patch fix time.Next stepsWe are happy to announce that Vanir is now available for public use. Vanir is not technically limited to Android, and we are also actively exploring problems that Vanir may help address, such as general C/C++ dependency management via integration with OSV-scanner. If you are interested in using or contributing to Vanir, please visit github.com/google/vanir. Please join our public community to submit your feedback and questions on the tool.¬†We look forward to working with you on Vanir!",

There‚Äôs no better time than Cyber Monday to trade up for a new and improved streaming video player, and we‚Äôve spotted some enticing deals on streaming devices from Amazon and Roku.\n\n\n\nAmazon is serving up deals on its latest streaming devices, including the just-released Fire TV Stick HD and Fire TV Stick 4K, while Roku is offering discounts on its popular Streaming Stick 4K, Express 4K+, and more.\n\n\n\nWe‚Äôre also keeping an eye out for Cyber Monday deals for the Apple TV 4K, Nvidia Shield, and Google Chromecast (including the new Google TV Streamer). We‚Äôll update our list as more deals go live.\n\n\n\nUpdated December 2, 2024: We‚Äôve added the latest streaming video player deals. Also, be sure to check out Cyber Monday discounts on home security cameras, video doorbells, Philips Hue smart lights, and more!¬†\n\n\n\nBest Black Friday deals on Amazon Fire TV streaming players\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick HD, $17.99 on Amazon (49% off)\n\n\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K, $21.99 on Amazon (56% off)\n\n\n\nAmazon Fire TV Cube (3rd gen), $99.99 on Amazon (29% off)\n\n\n\n\nBoth the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD and the Fire Stick 4K were released barely a month ago, meaning the latest generations of those streaming players are already getting big Black Friday discounts (particularly the Fire TV Stick 4K). \n\n\n\nYou can also nab a solid deal on the Fire TV Cube, which is capable of controlling your cable box with voice commands (courtesy of Alexa).\n\n\n\nBest Black Friday deals on Roku streaming players\n\n\n\n\nRoku Express 4K+, $24 on Amazon (40% off)\n\n\n\nRoku Streaming Stick 4K, $29 on Amazon (42% off)\n\n\n\nRoku Ultra LT, $57 on Amazon (19% off)\n\n\n\nRoku Ultra (2024), $79 on Amazon (21% off)\n\n\n\nRoku Streambar SE, $69 on Amazon (31% off)\n\n\n\n\nJust $24 for the Roku Express 4K+ streamer is a terrific price, while the discounted Roku Streaming Stick 4K ups the ante with Dolby Vision support for just five bucks more. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Roku‚Äôs top-of-the-line Ultra‚Äìnow with a backlit remote‚Äìis getting a Black Friday price cut, or you can opt for the Ultra LT, which shaves off a few features (namely a USB port) and includes a more basic remote for even less. \n\n\n\nFinally, the Roku Streambar SE is a compact soundbar with a built-in Roku streaming player, and it‚Äôs priced to move for Black Friday.\n\n\n\nIt‚Äôs worth noting that we skipped Roku‚Äôs cheapest players, the Roku LE and the Roku Express. As our columnist Jared Newman noted, they‚Äôre simply not very good players for the price, and you can do much better spending just a few dollars more for our picks.\n\n\n\n Black Friday streaming player deals: What you need to know \n1.\nWhen is Black Friday?\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the biggest shopping day in the U.S., Black Friday lands on the day after Thanksgiving‚Äìand this year, the big day comes on November 29, 2024.\n\n\n\nOf course, Black Friday deals will start popping up well before the actual day, and they‚Äôll generally continue through the weekend, leading up to Cyber Monday. \n\n\n\n\n\n2.\nWhat is Cyber Monday? \n\n\n\n\nA relatively new addition to the end-of-the-year shopping season, Cyber Monday hits the first Monday after Black Friday. For 2024, that means Monday, December 2.\n\n\n\nThe idea behind Cyber Monday was that it was a day of discounts for online shoppers, versus the in-person shopping spree that Black Friday used to be. Now, both shopping days are mostly about pointing and clicking.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\nWill there be streaming video player deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday?\n\n\n\n\nMost definitely, with Amazon and Roku generally serving up the most streaming video deals.\n\n\n\nWe also expect to see discounts on Google‚Äôs Chromecast players, while on rare occasions, Apple and Nvidia will cut prices on their Apple TV 4K and Nvidia Shield devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\nDo you have to be an Amazon Prime member to get Black Friday discounts?\n\n\n\n\nUnlike Prime Day, most Black Friday deals on Amazon are open to all shoppers, although you‚Äôll need to be a Prime member to get free shipping. Amazon discloses which deals are limited to Prime members.\n\n\n\nYou can¬†get Amazon Prime¬†for $14.99 a month, or $139 a year, and your membership includes a variety of benefits, including free shipping for Prime items, access to Prime Video, Amazon Music, Prime Reading, and more.\n\n\n\nNaturally, Prime isn‚Äôt needed when shopping at non-Amazon retailers, such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\nSpeaking of which, will other retailers offer their own Black Friday discounts? \n\n\n\n\nOf course! Be sure to keep an eye on¬†Best Buy,¬†Target,¬†Walmart, and other online stores as Black Friday and Cyber Monday progress.",

\n Posted by Ivan Fratric, Google Project Zero\n Recently, one of the projects I was involved in had to do with video decoding on Apple platforms, specifically AV1 decoding. On Apple devices that¬†support AV1 video format¬†(starting from Apple A17 iOS / M3 macOS), decoding is done in hardware. However, despite this, during decoding, a large part of the AV1 format parsing happens in software, inside the kernel, more specifically inside the AppleAVD kernel extension (or at least, that used to be the case in macOS 14/ iOS 17). As fuzzing is one of the techniques we employ regularly, the question of how to effectively fuzz this code inevitably came up.\n \n It should be noted that I wasn‚Äôt the first person to look into the problem of Apple kernel extension fuzzing, so before going into the details of my approach, other projects in this space should be mentioned.\n \n In the Fairplay research¬†project, @pwn0rz utilized a custom loader to load the kernel extension into userspace. A coworker tried to run this code on the current AppleAVD extension, however it didn‚Äôt work for them (at least not out of the box) so we didn‚Äôt end up using it. It should be noted here that my approach also loads the kernel code into userspace, albeit in a more lightweight way.\n \n In the Cinema time!¬†presentation at Hexacon 2022, Andrey Labunets and Nikita Tarakanov presented their approach for fuzzing AppleAVD where the decompiled code was first extracted using IDA and then rebuilt. I used this approach in the past in some more constrained scenarios, however the decompiled code from IDA is not perfect and manual fixing was often required (such as, for example, when IDA would get the stack layout of a function incorrectly).\n \n In the KextFuzz¬†project, Tingting Yin with the co-authors statically instrumented kernel extensions by replacing pointer authentication instructions with a jump to a coverage-collecting trampoline, which results in a partial coverage.\n \n Most recently, the Pishi¬†project by Meysam Firouzi was released just before this research. The project statically instruments kernel extension code by using Ghidra to identify all basic blocks, and then replacing one instruction from each basic block with a branch to a dedicated trampoline. The trampoline records the coverage, executes the replaced instruction and jumps back to the address of the next instruction. This was reported to run on a real device.\n \n Given the existence of these other projects, it is worth saying that my goal was not to create necessarily the ‚Äúbest‚Äù method for kernel extension fuzzing, but what for me was the simplest (if we don‚Äôt count the underlying complexity of the off-the shelf tools being used). In short, my approach, that will be discussed in detail in other sections, was\n Load AppleAVD extension or full kernelcache into IDARebase the module to an address that can be reliably allocated in userspaceExport raw memory using an IDA Python scriptLoad exported bytes using custom loaderUse custom TinyInst¬†module to hook and instrument the extensionUse Jackalope¬†for fuzzing\n \n All the project code can be found here. Various components will be explained in more detail throughout the rest of the blog post.Extracting kernel extension code\n Normally, on macOS, kernel extensions are packaged inside ‚Äúkernel collections‚Äù files that serve as containers for multiple extensions. At first OS boot (and whenever something is changed with regards to kernel extensions), the kernel extensions needed by the machine are repackaged into what is called the ‚Äúkernel cache‚Äù (kernelcache¬†file on the filesystem). Kernel extensions can be extracted from these caches and collections, but existing tooling can‚Äôt really produce individual .dylib files that can be loaded into userspace and run without issues.\n \n However, reverse engineering tooling, specifically IDA Pro which I used in this research, comes with a surprisingly good loader for Apple kernel cache. I haven‚Äôt tried how other reverse engineering tools compare, but if they are comparable and someone would like to contribute to the project, I would gladly accept export scripts for these other tools.\n \n So, instead of writing our own loader, we can simply piggyback on IDA‚Äôs. The idea is simple:we let IDA load the kernel extension we want (or even the entire kernelcache)we use IDA to rebase the code so it‚Äôs in memory range that is mappable in userspace (see image)using a simple IDA Python script, we export for each memory segment its start address, end address, protection flags and raw bytesoptionally, we can also, using the same script, export all the symbol names and the corresponding addresses so we can later refer to symbols by name\n \n The following image shows rebasing of the kernel extension. This functionality is accessible in IDA via Edit- >Segments- >Rebase program‚Ä¶¬†menu. When choosing the new base address, it is convenient to only change the high bits which makes it easy to manually convert rebased to original addresses and vice versa when needed. In the example below the image base was changed from 0xFFFFFE000714C470¬†to ¬†0xAB0714C470.\n \n \n Figure 1: Rebasing the extension\n \n The IDA script for exporting the data can be found here. You can run it using the following commands in IDA:\n \n sys.path.append('/directory/containing/export/script')\n import segexport\n segexport.export('/path/to/output/file)Loading and running\n Loading the exported data should now be only the matter of memory mapping the correct addresses and copying the corresponding data from the exported file. You can see it in the load()¬†function here.\n \n However, since we are now loading and running kernel code in userspace, there will be functions that won‚Äôt run well or that we would want to change. One example for this are the kernel allocator functions that we‚Äôll want to replace with the system malloc.\n \n One way of replacing these functions would be to rewrite the prolog of each function we want to replace with a jump to its replacement. However, since we will later be using TinyInst¬†to extract code coverage, there is a simpler way. We will simply write a breakpoint instruction to each function we want to replace. Since TinyInst is (among other things) a debugger, it will catch each of these breakpoints and, from the TinyInst process, we can replace the instruction pointer with the address of the corresponding replacement function. More details on this can be found in the next section.\n \n Besides replacing the memory allocation functions, logging functions etc., we will also need to replace all functions that interact with the hardware that we can‚Äôt access from userspace (or, in our case, that isn‚Äôt even present on the machine). In the case of AV1 parsing code in the AppleAVD kernel extension, a function called AppleAVD::sendCommandToCommandGate¬†gets called, which I assume is meant to communicate with the decoding hardware. Thus, as a part of the harness, this function was replaced with a function that always returns 0 (success).\n \n The final code of the AV1 harness code can be found here. It can be compiled as\n \n clang++ loader.cpp avdharness.cpp -oloader\n \n and might need some additional entitlements to run which can be applied with\n \n codesign --entitlements entitlements.txt -f -s - ./loader\n \n Note that, in the harness code, although I tried to rely on symbol names instead of hardcoded offsets wherever possible, it still contains some struct offsets. This version of the harness was based on¬†macos 14.5 kernel, which was the most recent OS version at the time the loader was written.Writing a custom TinyInst module\n This section explains the custom TinyInst module that accompanies the loader (and is required for the correct functioning of the loader). This code doesn‚Äôt contain anything specific for a particular kernel extension and thus can be reused as is. If you are not interested in how it works or writing custom TinyInst modules, then you can skip this section.\n \n Firstly, since we will want to extract code coverage for the purposes of fuzzing, we will base our custom module on LiteCov, the ‚Äúdefault‚Äù TinyInst module for code coverage:\n \n class¬†AVDInst¬†:¬†public¬†LiteCov¬†{\n ¬† ‚Ä¶\n };\n \n Secondly, we need a way for our custom loader to communicate with the TinyInst moduleIt needs to tell TinyInst which functions in the kext should be replaced with which replacement functions.It needs to tell TinyInst where the kext was loaded so that TinyInst can instrument it.\n \n While TinyInst provides an API for function hooking¬†that we could use here, there is also a more direct (albeit, also more low-level) way. From our loader, we will simply call a function at some hardcoded non-mapped address. This will, once again, cause an exception that TinyInst (being a debugger) will catch, read the parameters from registers, do the required action and ‚Äúreturn‚Äù (by replacing the instruction pointer with the value inside the link register). The loader uses the hardcoded address 0x747265706C616365¬†to register a replacement and 0x747265706C616366¬†to tell TinyInst about the address range to instrument:\n \n #define¬†TINYINST_REGISTER_REPLACEMENT 0x747265706C616365\n #define¬†TINYINST_CUSTOM_INSTRUMENT 0x747265706C616366\n \n We can catch those in the exception handler of our custom module\n \n bool¬†AVDInst::OnException(Exception¬†*exception_record)¬†{\n ¬† ‚Ä¶\n ¬† if(exception_address ==¬†TINYINST_REGISTER_REPLACEMENT)¬†{\n ¬† ¬† RegisterReplacementHook();\n ¬† ¬† return¬†true;\n ¬† }\n \n ¬† if(exception_address ==¬†TINYINST_CUSTOM_INSTRUMENT)¬†{\n ¬† ¬† InstrumentCustomRange();\n ¬† ¬† return¬†true;\n ¬† }\n ¬† ‚Ä¶\n }\n \n and then read the parameters and do the required action\n \n void¬†AVDInst::RegisterReplacementHook()¬†{\n ¬† uint64_t original_address =¬†GetRegister(X0);\n ¬† uint64_t replacement_address =¬†GetRegister(X1);\n \n ¬† redirects[original_address]¬†=¬†replacement_address;\n \n ¬† SetRegister(ARCH_PC,¬†GetRegister(LR));\n }\n \n void¬†AVDInst::InstrumentCustomRange()¬†{\n ¬† uint64_t min_address =¬†GetRegister(X0);\n ¬† uint64_t max_address =¬†GetRegister(X1);\n \n ¬† InstrumentAddressRange(\"__custom_range__\",¬†min_address,¬†max_address);\n \n ¬† SetRegister(ARCH_PC,¬†GetRegister(LR));\n }\n \n Where InstrumentAddressRange¬†is a recently added TinyInst function that will instrument all code between addresses given in its parameters. ‚Äú__custom_range__‚Äù is simply a name that we give to this region of memory so we can differentiate between multiple instrumented modules (if there are more than one).\n \n Next, TinInst needs to perform the actual function replacements. As explained above, this can be done in the exception handler of our module.\n \n ¬† auto¬†iter =¬†redirects.find(exception_address);\n ¬† if(iter !=¬†redirects.end())¬†{\n ¬† ¬† // printf(\"Redirecting...n\");\n ¬† ¬† SetRegister(ARCH_PC,¬†iter- >second);\n ¬† ¬† return¬†true;\n ¬† }\n \n This is mostly sufficient for running the kernel extension without instrumenting it (e.g. to collect coverage). However, if we also want to instrument the extension, then the process of instrumentation involves rewriting the extension code in another location and inserting e.g. additional instructions to record coverage. The consequence of this is that our breakpoint instructions (that we inserted for the purpose of redirects) will be rewritten at different addresses. We need to make TinyInst aware of this (as a side note, TinyInst Hook API does this under the hood, but it wasn‚Äôt used in this module). We can do this in the InstrumentInstruction function which gets called for every instruction as it‚Äôs being instrumented:\n \n InstructionResult¬†AVDInst::InstrumentInstruction(ModuleInfo¬†*module,\n ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Instruction&¬†inst,\n ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† size_t bb_address,\n ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† size_t instruction_address)\n {\n ¬† auto¬†iter =¬†redirects.find(instruction_address);\n ¬† if(iter !=¬†redirects.end())¬†{\n ¬† ¬† instrumented_redirects[assembler_- >Breakpoint(module)]¬†=¬†iter- >second;\n ¬† ¬† return¬†INST_STOPBB;\n ¬† }\n \n ¬† return¬†LiteCov::InstrumentInstruction(module,¬†inst,¬†bb_address,¬†instruction_address);\n }\n \n The INST_STOPBB¬†return value tells TinyInst to stop processing the current basic blocks. Since on breakpoints/redirects, we redirect the execution to another function, no other instructions from the same basic block ever get executed and are thus unneeded.\n \n After this, we now know the addresses of breakpoints (and the corresponding replacements) in both instrumented and non-instrumented code. The final exception handler of our custom module looks like this:\n \n bool¬†AVDInst::OnException(Exception¬†*exception_record)¬†{\n ¬† size_t exception_address;\n \n ¬† if(exception_record- >type ==¬†BREAKPOINT)\n ¬† {\n ¬† ¬† exception_address =¬†(size_t)exception_record- >ip;\n ¬† }¬†else¬†if(exception_record- >type ==¬†ACCESS_VIOLATION)¬†{\n ¬† ¬† exception_address =¬†(size_t)exception_record- >access_address;\n ¬† }¬†else¬†{\n ¬† ¬† return¬†LiteCov::OnException(exception_record);\n ¬† }\n \n ¬† if(exception_address ==¬†TINYINST_REGISTER_REPLACEMENT)¬†{\n ¬† ¬† RegisterReplacementHook();\n ¬† ¬† return¬†true;\n ¬† }\n \n ¬† if(exception_address ==¬†TINYINST_CUSTOM_INSTRUMENT)¬†{\n ¬† ¬† InstrumentCustomRange();\n ¬† ¬† return¬†true;\n ¬† }\n \n ¬† auto¬†iter =¬†redirects.find(exception_address);\n ¬† if(iter !=¬†redirects.end())¬†{\n ¬† ¬† // printf(\"Redirecting...n\");\n ¬† ¬† SetRegister(ARCH_PC,¬†iter- >second);\n ¬† ¬† return¬†true;\n ¬† }\n \n ¬† iter =¬†instrumented_redirects.find(exception_address);\n ¬† if(iter !=¬†instrumented_redirects.end())¬†{\n ¬† ¬† // printf(\"Redirecting...n\");\n ¬† ¬† SetRegister(ARCH_PC,¬†iter- >second);\n ¬† ¬† return¬†true;\n ¬† }\n \n ¬† return¬†LiteCov::OnException(exception_record);\n }\n \n The entire code, with all the housekeeping functions can be found here.Fuzzing and findings\n Once our custom module is ready, we still need to make sure TinyInst and Jackalope will use this module instead of the default LiteCov module. See the appropriate patches for TinyInst¬†and Jackalope.\n \n Our harness should now run correctly under TinyInst, both without and with coverage instrumentation:\n \n ./Jackalope/build/TinyInst/Release/litecov -- ./loader avd_rebased.dat -f \n \n Where avd_rebased.dat¬†contains the kernel extension code exported from IDA. We can also add the -trace_basic_blocks¬†flag to trace basic blocks as they are being executed (primarily useful for debugging). We can also run a fuzzing session with Jackalope like this:\n \n ./Jackalope/build/Release/fuzzer -in in -out out -t 1000 -delivery shmem -target_module loader -target_method __Z4fuzzPc -nargs 1 -iterations 5000 -persist -loop -cmp_coverage -mute_child -nthreads 6 -- ./loader avd_rebased.dat -m @@\n \n This tells jackalope to run in persistent mode (with the function ‚Äúfuzz‚Äù being looped), with sample delivery over shared memory (-delivery shmem¬†fuzzer flag and -m¬†being implemented in the harness code).\n \n Fuzzing is useful not only for finding bugs in the target, but in our case also for finding bugs in the harness, e.g. finding other kernel functions we need to replace in order for the target to work correctly.\n \n After several iterations of fixups, the harness appeared to be working correctly. However, the fuzzer also caught some crashes that appeared to have been caused by genuine issues in the AV1 parsing code. I did a root cause analysis and reported the issues to Apple. The reports can be seen in the following entries in the Project Zero issue tracker:\n AppleAVD: Large OBU size in AV1_Syntax::Parse_Header reading to out-of-bounds readsAppleAVD: Issue with AV1_Syntax::f leading to out-of-bounds readsAppleAVD: Integer underflow in AV1_Syntax::Parse_Header leading to out-of-bounds reads\n \n Unfortunately, at the time of reporting these issues I still didn‚Äôt have access to a machine with AV1 decoding capabilities. Thus, instead of full end-to-end PoCs, the issues were reported in the form of a full root cause analysis and a binary stream that causes a crash when used as a parameter to a particular decoding function. Eventually, we did get a Macbook with a M3 chip that supports AV1 hardware decoding and tried to reproduce the reported issues. Unsurprisingly, all three issues reproduced exactly the same on the real hardware as in the userspace harness.Conclusion\n The goal of this project was to create userspace kernel extension fuzzing tooling¬†that was as simple as possible, and at least one of the reasons for this simplicity was that it could be easily adapted to other pieces of kernel code. The process is versatile enough that it allowed us to fuzz AV1 parsing code that normally requires hardware we didn‚Äôt even have at the time. While the three issues found during this research are not critical, they demonstrate the correctness of the approach and the potential for finding other issues.",

      "contentSnippet": "Posted by Oliver Chang, Dongge Liu and Jonathan Metzman, Google Open Source Security TeamRecently, OSS-Fuzz reported 26 new vulnerabilities to open source project maintainers, including one vulnerability in the critical OpenSSL library (CVE-2024-9143) that underpins much of internet infrastructure. The reports themselves aren‚Äôt unusual‚Äîwe‚Äôve reported and helped maintainers fix over 11,000 vulnerabilities in the 8 years of the project.¬†But these particular vulnerabilities represent a milestone for automated vulnerability finding: each was found with AI, using AI-generated and enhanced fuzz targets. The OpenSSL CVE is one of the first vulnerabilities in a critical piece of software that was discovered by LLMs, adding another real-world example to a recent Google discovery of an exploitable stack buffer underflow in the widely used database engine SQLite.This blog post discusses the results and lessons over a year and a half of work to bring AI-powered fuzzing to this point, both in introducing AI into fuzz target generation and expanding this to simulate a developer‚Äôs workflow. These efforts continue our explorations of how AI can transform vulnerability discovery and strengthen the arsenal of defenders everywhere.The story so farIn August 2023, the OSS-Fuzz team announced AI-Powered Fuzzing, describing our effort to leverage large language models (LLM) to improve fuzzing coverage to find more vulnerabilities automatically‚Äîbefore malicious attackers could exploit them. Our approach was to use the coding abilities of an LLM to generate more fuzz targets, which are similar to unit tests that exercise relevant functionality to search for vulnerabilities.¬†The ideal solution would be to completely automate the manual process of developing a fuzz target end to end:Drafting an initial fuzz target.Fixing any compilation issues that arise.¬†Running the fuzz target to see how it performs, and fixing any obvious mistakes causing runtime issues.Running the corrected fuzz target for a longer period of time, and triaging any crashes to determine the root cause.Fixing vulnerabilities.¬†In August 2023, we covered our efforts to use an LLM to handle the first two steps. We were able to use an iterative process to generate a fuzz target with a simple prompt including hardcoded examples and compilation errors.¬†In January 2024, we open sourced the framework that we were building to enable an LLM to generate fuzz targets. By that point, LLMs were reliably generating targets that exercised more interesting code coverage across 160 projects. But there was still a long tail of projects where we couldn‚Äôt get a single working AI-generated fuzz target.To address this, we‚Äôve been improving the first two steps, as well as implementing steps 3 and 4.New results: More code coverage and discovered vulnerabilitiesWe‚Äôre now able to automatically gain more coverage in 272 C/C++ projects on OSS-Fuzz (up from 160), adding 370k+ lines of new code coverage. The top coverage improvement in a single project was an increase from 77 lines to 5434 lines (a 7000% increase).This led to the discovery of 26 new vulnerabilities in projects on OSS-Fuzz that already had hundreds of thousands of hours of fuzzing. The highlight is CVE-2024-9143 in the critical and well-tested OpenSSL library. We reported this vulnerability on September 16 and a fix was published on October 16. As far as we can tell, this vulnerability has likely been present for two decades and wouldn‚Äôt have been discoverable with existing fuzz targets written by humans.Another example was a bug in the project cJSON, where even though an existing human-written harness existed to fuzz a specific function, we still discovered a new vulnerability in that same function with an AI-generated target.¬†One reason that such bugs could remain undiscovered for so long is that line coverage is not a guarantee that a function is free of bugs. Code coverage as a metric isn‚Äôt able to measure all possible code paths and states‚Äîdifferent flags and configurations may trigger different behaviors, unearthing different bugs. These examples underscore the need to continue to generate new varieties of fuzz targets even for code that is already fuzzed, as has also been shown by Project Zero in the past (1, 2).New improvementsTo achieve these results, we‚Äôve been focusing on two major improvements:Automatically generate more relevant context in our prompts. The more complete and relevant information we can provide the LLM about a project, the less likely it would be to hallucinate the missing details in its response. This meant providing more accurate, project-specific context in prompts, such as function, type definitions, cross references, and existing unit tests for each project. To generate this information automatically, we built new infrastructure to index projects across OSS-Fuzz.¬†LLMs turned out to be highly effective at emulating a typical developer‚Äôs entire workflow of writing, testing, and iterating on the fuzz target, as well as triaging the crashes found. Thanks to this, it was possible to further automate more parts of the fuzzing workflow. This additional iterative feedback in turn also resulted in higher quality and greater number of correct fuzz targets.¬†The workflow in actionOur LLM can now execute the first four steps of the developer‚Äôs process (with the fifth soon to come).¬†1. Drafting an initial fuzz targetA developer might check the source code, existing documentation and unit tests, as well as¬† usages of the target function when to draft an initial fuzz target. An LLM can fulfill this role here, if we provide a prompt with this information and ask it to come up with a fuzz target.¬†Prompt:¬†Your goal is to write a fuzzing harness for the provided function-under-test signature using LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput. It is important that the provided solution compiles and actually calls the function-under-test specified by the function signature:unsigned char * buffer_append_base64_decode(buffer *, const char *, size_t, base64_charset)Here is the source code of the function being tested:unsigned char* buffer_append_base64_decode(buffer *out, const char* in, size_t in_length, base64_charset charset) {¬†¬†¬†¬†const size_t reserve = 3*(in_length/4) + 3;¬†¬†¬†¬†unsigned char * const result = (unsigned char *)¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†buffer_string_prepare_append(out, reserve);¬†¬†¬†¬†const size_t out_pos =¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†li_base64_dec(result, reserve, in, in_length, charset);¬†¬†¬†¬†buffer_commit(out, out_pos);¬†¬†¬†¬†return (out_pos || !in_length) ? result : NULL;}Here is the source code for functions which reference the function being tested:‚Ä¶¬†¬†2. Fixing any compilation issues that arise.¬†Once a developer has a candidate target, they would try to compile it and look at any compilation issues that arise. Again, we can prompt an LLM with details of the compilation errors so it can provide fixes.¬†¬†Prompt:¬†Below is the error to fix:The code has the following build issues:server_fuzzer.cc:12:46: error: only virtual member functions can be marked 'override'¬†¬†¬†12 | ¬† bool OnData(const char* data, size_t size) override {¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†|¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ^~~~~~~~server_fuzzer.cc:22:39: error: no type named 'MultiPartFile' in namespace 'httplib'¬†¬†¬†22 |¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† const httplib::MultiPartFile& file) override {¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†|¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ~~~~~~~~~^server_fuzzer.cc:12:27: warning: unused parameter 'data' [-Wunused-parameter]¬†¬†¬†12 | ¬† bool OnData(const char* data, size_t size) override {¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†| ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ^server_fuzzer.cc:37:5: error: use of undeclared 'operator()'¬†¬†¬†37 | ¬† ¬† operator()(request_data.data(), receiver);¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†| ¬† ¬† ^server_fuzzer.cc:27:23: warning: private field 'provider_' is not used [-Wunused-private-field]¬†¬†¬†27 | ¬† FuzzedDataProvider& provider_;¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†| ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ^Example of compilation errors that an LLM was able to fix3. Running the fuzz target to see how it performs, and fixing any obvious mistakes causing runtime issues.Once all compilation errors are fixed, a developer would try running the fuzz target for a short period of time to see if there were any mistakes that led it to instantly crash, suggesting an error with the target rather than a bug discovered in the project.The following is an example of an LLM fixing a semantic issue with the fuzzing setup:¬†LLM Response:The issue is that `sqlite3_blob_open` requires the table to exist before you can open a blob on it. The fix ensures that the table exists by executing a `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statement before calling `sqlite3_blob_open`.¬†Here's a breakdown of the changes:1. **Create Table Query:** A string `createTableQuery` is constructed to hold the SQL statement for creating the table. It uses the fuzzed values for the table and column names.2. **Prepare Statement:** `sqlite3_prepare_v2` is used to prepare the SQL statement from `createTableQuery`. This compiles the SQL into a byte-code program that SQLite can execute.3. **Execute Statement:** `sqlite3_step` executes the prepared statement. Since it's a `CREATE TABLE` statement, it doesn't return any data, but it creates the table if it doesn't exist.4. **Finalize Statement:** `sqlite3_finalize` destroys the prepared statement object when it's no longer needed.By adding these steps before calling `sqlite3_blob_open`, we ensure that the table exists, preventing the null pointer access issue.¬†4. Running the corrected fuzz target for a longer period of time, and triaging any crashes.At this point, the fuzz target is ready to run for an extended period of time on a suitable fuzzing infrastructure, such as ClusterFuzz.¬†Any discovered crashes would then need to be triaged, to determine the root causes and whether they represented legitimate vulnerabilities (or bugs in the fuzz target). An LLM can be prompted with the relevant context (stacktraces, fuzz target source code, relevant project source code) to perform this triage.¬†Prompt: Given the following crash report, fuzz driver code and relevant project function code, analyze the cause of the crash.First, only answer ‚ÄúCrash is caused by bug in fuzz driver‚Äù or ‚ÄúCrash is caused by bug in project‚Äù. Second, offer a succinct and to-the-point analysis.Below is crash report:AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free on address 0x502000000630 at pc 0x560036939242 bp 0x7ffd65dca850 sp 0x7ffd65dca010READ of size 1 at 0x502000000630 thread T0SCARINESS: 40 (1-byte-read-heap-use-after-free)¬†¬†¬†¬†#0 0x560036939241 in __asan_memcpy /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_interceptors_memintrinsics.cpp:63:3¬†¬†¬†¬†#1 0x56003697d30b in EmitLiteral /src/snappy/snappy.cc:661:5¬†¬†¬†¬†#2 0x56003697d30b in snappy::internal::CompressFragment(char const*, unsigned long, char*, unsigned short*, int) /src/snappy/snappy.cc:954:10In this example, the LLM correctly determines this is a bug in the fuzz target, rather than a bug in the project being fuzzed.¬†LLM Response: Crash is caused by bug in fuzz driver.The fuzz driver creates a vector of `iovec` structures, each pointing to a chunk of memory owned by the `FuzzedDataProvider`. However, the `data_chunk` vector, which holds the actual data pointed to by `iov_base`, is deallocated at the end of each fuzzer iteration when it goes out of scope. This leaves the `iov_base` pointers dangling. When `snappy::CompressFromIOVec` tries to access the memory pointed to by these dangling pointers, a heap-use-after-free occurs.¬†5. Fixing vulnerabilities.¬†The goal is to fully automate this entire workflow by having the LLM generate a suggested patch for the vulnerability. We don‚Äôt have anything we can share here today, but we‚Äôre collaborating with various researchers to make this a reality and look forward to sharing results soon.¬†Up nextImproving automated triaging: to get to a point where we‚Äôre confident about not requiring human review. This will help automatically report new vulnerabilities to project maintainers. There are likely more than the 26 vulnerabilities we‚Äôve already reported upstream hiding in our results.Agent-based architecture: which means letting the LLM autonomously plan out the steps to solve a particular problem by providing it with access to tools that enable it to get more information, as well as to check and validate results. By providing LLM with interactive access to real tools such as debuggers, we‚Äôve found that the LLM is more likely to arrive at a correct result.Integrating our research into OSS-Fuzz as a feature: to achieve a more fully automated end-to-end solution for vulnerability discovery and patching. We hope OSS-Fuzz will be useful for other researchers to evaluate AI-powered vulnerability discovery ideas and ultimately become a tool that will enable defenders to find more vulnerabilities before they get exploited.¬†For more information, check out our open source framework at oss-fuzz-gen. We‚Äôre hoping to continue to collaborate on this area with other researchers. Also, be sure to check out the OSS-Fuzz blog for more technical updates.",

      "link": "http://security.googleblog.com/2024/11/retrofitting-spatial-safety-to-hundreds.html",
      "contentSnippet": "Posted by Alex Rebert and Max Shavrick, Security Foundations, and Kinuko Yasuda, Core Developer\n\n\n\n\nAttackers regularly exploit spatial memory safety vulnerabilities, which occur when code accesses a memory allocation outside of its intended bounds, to compromise systems and sensitive data. These vulnerabilities represent a major security risk to users.¬†\n\n\n\nBased on an analysis of in-the-wild exploits tracked by Google's Project Zero, spatial safety vulnerabilities represent 40% of in-the-wild memory safety exploits over the past decade:\n\n\n\n\nBreakdown of memory safety CVEs exploited in the wild by vulnerability class.1\n\nGoogle is taking a comprehensive approach to memory safety. A key element of our strategy focuses on Safe Coding and using memory-safe languages in new code. This leads to an exponential decline in memory safety vulnerabilities and quickly improves the overall security posture of a codebase, as demonstrated by our post about Android's journey to memory safety.\n\n\nHowever, this transition will take multiple years as we adapt our development practices and infrastructure. Ensuring the safety of our billions of users therefore requires us to go further: we're also retrofitting secure-by-design principles to our existing C++ codebase wherever possible.\n\nTo that end, we're working towards bringing spatial memory safety into as many of our C++ codebases as possible, including Chrome and the monolithic codebase powering our services.\n\nWe‚Äôve begun by enabling hardened libc++, which adds bounds checking to standard C++ data structures, eliminating a significant class of spatial safety bugs. While C++ will not become fully memory-safe, these improvements reduce risk as discussed in more detail in our perspective on memory safety, leading to more reliable and secure software.\n\nThis post explains how we're retrofitting hardened libc++ across our codebases and¬† showcases the positive impact it's already having, including preventing exploits, reducing crashes, and improving code correctness.\n\nBounds-checked data structures: The foundation for spatial safety\n\nOne of our primary strategies for improving spatial safety in C++ is to implement bounds checking for common data structures, starting with hardening the C++ standard library (in our case, LLVM‚Äôs libc++). Hardened libc++, recently added by open source contributors, introduces a set of security checks designed to catch vulnerabilities such as out-of-bounds accesses in production.\n\nFor example, hardened libc++ ensures that every access to an element of a std::vector stays within its allocated bounds, preventing attempts to read or write beyond the valid memory region. Similarly, hardened libc++ checks that a std::optional isn't empty before allowing access, preventing access to uninitialized memory.\n\nThis approach mirrors what's already standard practice in many modern programming languages like Java, Python, Go, and Rust. They all incorporate bounds checking by default, recognizing its crucial role in preventing memory errors. C++ has been a notable exception, but efforts like hardened libc++ aim to close this gap in our infrastructure. It‚Äôs also worth noting that similar hardening is available in other C++ standard libraries, such as libstdc++.\n\nRaising the security baseline across the board\n\nBuilding on the successful deployment of hardened libc++ in Chrome in 2022, we've now made it default across our server-side production systems. This improves spatial memory safety across our services, including key performance-critical components of products like Search, Gmail, Drive, YouTube, and Maps. While a very small number of components remain opted out, we're actively working to reduce this and raise the bar for security across the board, even in applications with lower exploitation risk.\n\nThe performance impact of these changes was surprisingly low, despite Google's modern C++ codebase making heavy use of libc++. Hardening libc++ resulted in an average 0.30% performance impact across our services (yes, only a third of a percent).\n \nThis is due to both the compiler's ability to eliminate redundant checks during optimization, and the efficient design of hardened libc++. While a handful of performance-critical code paths still require targeted use of explicitly unsafe accesses, these instances are carefully reviewed for safety. Techniques like profile-guided optimizations further improved performance, but even without those advanced techniques, the overhead of bounds checking remains minimal.\n \nWe actively monitor the performance impact of these checks and work to minimize any unnecessary overhead. For instance, we identified and fixed an unnecessary check, which led to a 15% reduction in overhead (reduced from 0.35% to 0.3%), and contributed the fix back to the LLVM project to share the benefits with the broader C++ community. \n\nWhile hardened libc++'s overhead is minimal for individual applications in most cases, deploying it at Google's scale required a substantial commitment of computing resources. This investment underscores our dedication to enhancing the safety and security of our products.\n \n From tests to production\n \nEnabling libc++ hardening wasn't a simple flip of a switch. Rather, it required a multi-stage rollout to avoid accidentally disrupting users or creating an outage:\n\n Testing: We first enabled hardened libc++ in our tests over a year ago. This allowed us to identify and fix hundreds of previously undetected bugs in our code and tests.\n Baking: We let the hardened runtime \"bake\" in our testing and pre-production environments, giving developers time to adapt and address any new issues that surfaced. We also conducted extensive performance evaluations, ensuring minimal impact to our users' experience.\n Gradual Production Rollout: We then rolled out hardened libc++ to production over several months, starting with a small set of services and gradually expanding to our entire infrastructure. We closely monitored the rollout, promptly addressing any crashes or performance regressions.\n \n \n Quantifiable impact\n \n In just a few months since enabling hardened libc++ by default, we've already seen benefits.\n\n Preventing exploits: Hardened libc++ has already disrupted an internal red team exercise and would have prevented another one that happened before we enabled hardening, demonstrating its effectiveness in thwarting exploits. The safety checks have uncovered over 1,000 bugs, and would prevent 1,000 to 2,000 new bugs yearly at our current rate of C++ development.\n\n Improved reliability and correctness: The process of identifying and fixing bugs uncovered by hardened libc++ led to a 30% reduction in our baseline segmentation fault rate across production, indicating improved code reliability and quality. Beyond crashes, the checks also caught errors that would have otherwise manifested as unpredictable behavior or data corruption.\n\n \n \n Moving average of segfaults across our fleet over time, before and after enablement.\n \n\n Easier debugging: Hardened libc++ enabled us to identify and fix multiple bugs that had been lurking in our code for more than a decade. The checks transform many difficult-to-diagnose memory corruptions into immediate and easily debuggable errors, saving developers valuable time and effort. \n \n Bridging the gap with memory-safe languages\n\nWhile libc++ hardening provides immediate benefits by adding bounds checking to standard data structures, it's only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to spatial safety.\n\nWe're expanding bounds checking to other libraries and working to migrate our code to Safe Buffers, requiring all accesses to be bounds checked. For spatial safety, both hardened data structures, including their iterators, and Safe Buffers are necessary.\n\nBeyond improving the safety of our C++, we're also focused on making it easier to interoperate with memory-safe languages. Migrating our C++ to Safe Buffers shrinks the gap between the languages, which simplifies interoperability and potentially even an eventual automated translation.\n\n Building a safer C++ ecosystem\n\nHardened libc++ is a practical and effective way to enhance the safety, reliability, and debuggability of C++ code with minimal overhead. Given this, we strongly encourage organizations using C++ to enable their standard library's hardened mode universally by default.\n\nAt Google, enabling hardened libc++ is only the first step in our journey towards a spatially safe C++ codebase. By expanding bounds checking, migrating to Safe Buffers, and actively collaborating with the broader C++ community, we aim to create a future where spatial safety is the norm.\n\n Acknowledgements\n\nWe‚Äôd like to thank Emilia Kasper, Chandler Carruth, Duygu Isler, Matthew Riley, and Jeff Vander Stoep for their helpful feedback. We also extend our thanks to the libc++ community for developing the hardening mode that made this work possible.",
