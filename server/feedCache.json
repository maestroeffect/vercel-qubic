      "contentSnippet": "Last year, Honda teased its first two homegrown EVs with the Series 0 Saloon and Space-Hub. But now at CES 2025, those vehicles are getting one step closer to production by graduating from concepts to prototypes while getting updated names along the way: the Honda 0 Saloon and 0 SUV.\nBut while we wait for them to officially hit the road sometime in 2026, I wanted to take a closer look at the evolved styling of Honda’s upcoming electric cars. Particularly the 0 SUV, not only because it’s gotten a much larger facelift, but lets admit it, it’s what we in the crossover-hungry US really want.\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford/Engadget\nOn the outside, the Honda’s 0 SUV looks like a mix between the Polestar 3 and the Hyundai Ioniq 9. It’s got a really minimalist, almost spaceship-like design that eschews that teardrop shape you see in a lot of other EV SUVs for something slightly boxier. This gives you more headroom for rear seat passengers and tons of extra vertical cargo space in back. The SUV’s pixelated headlights help reinforce its digital pedigree while I think Honda did a much better job in back of trying to make a clean and simple rear end without ending up a huge blank slate like on the Ioniq 9.\nThe 0 SUV’s overall proportions almost make it look like a tall, lifted wagon, especially when sat next to the 0 saloon. But that’s not necessarily a bad thing. Inside, Honda continues with the clean lines, though I wouldn’t necessarily read much into the general placement and look of its screens and dash. Like a lot of pre-production cars, those details are very much subject to change before its design is properly finalized. Same goes for those side-view cameras, which due to US laws, still don’t comply with regulations. However, Honda’s streamlined cabin does line up with the company’s “Thin, Light and Wise” design philosophy, which includes the move to a steer-by-wire driving system instead of relying on more traditional physical linkages.\nBut enough talking, let’s check out the cars.\nThe Honda 0 SUV prototype\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\n\nThe Honda 0 Saloon prototype\n\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\nPhoto by Sam Rutherford\n\n\nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/a-closer-look-at-the-slick-honda-0-suv-and-saloon-prototypes-at-ces-2025-134550129.html?src=rss",

      "link": "https://dev.to/hasunnilupul/exploring-the-vue-3-composition-api-comprehensive-guide-advantages-and-developer-experience-28ki",
      "contentSnippet": "Vue 3 brought a paradigm shift with its Composition API, enabling developers to write modular, reusable, and maintainable code in a more organized way. In this article, we’ll delve into what the Composition API is, provide comprehensive examples, highlight its advantages, and discuss how it impacts the developer experience (DX).\n\n\n \n \n What is the Composition API?\n\n\nThe Composition API is an alternative to Vue’s Options API, introduced to address the growing complexity of managing state, logic, and component interactions in larger applications. It allows developers to define logic in plain JavaScript functions, promoting better reusability and a more composable structure.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Key Features of the Composition API\n\n\n\n\nEncapsulation of Logic: Logic can be grouped and reused across components without relying on mixins or higher-order components.\n\nImproved TypeScript Support: It integrates seamlessly with TypeScript for better type inference.\n\nFine-grained Control: Offers developers more flexibility in organizing and managing state and lifecycle hooks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Basic Example of Composition API\n\n\nLet’s build a simple counter to demonstrate the core concepts.\n\n\n \n \n Counter Example\n\n\n\n\n\n\nimport { ref } from 'vue';\n\nexport default {\n setup() {\n  // Reactive state\n  const count = ref(0);\n\n  // Methods\n  const increment = () = > {\n   count.value++;\n  };\n\n  const decrement = () = > {\n   count.value--;\n  };\n\n  return { count, increment, decrement };\n },\n};\n\n\n\n \n  Count: {{ count }}\n  Increment\n  Decrement\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nExplanation:\n\n\n\nReactive State: ref creates a reactive state, count.\n\nExposed to Template: setup returns count, increment, and decrement, making them available in the template.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Advantages of the Composition API\n\n\n\n \n \n 1. Improved Code Reusability\n\n\nThe Composition API allows logic to be extracted into reusable functions.\n\nExample: A Reusable Counter Logic\n\n\n\n// useCounter.js\nimport { ref } from 'vue';\n\nexport function useCounter() {\n const count = ref(0);\n const increment = () = > count.value++;\n const decrement = () = > count.value--;\n\n return { count, increment, decrement };\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUsage in Components:\n\n\n\n\nimport { useCounter } from './useCounter';\n\nexport default {\n setup() {\n  return useCounter();\n },\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBy decoupling the logic, we can reuse useCounter in multiple components.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n 2. Organized and Modular Code\n\n\nWith the Composition API, lifecycle hooks and logic are grouped by functionality rather than Vue’s Options API sections (e.g., data, methods).\n\nBefore (Options API):\n\n\n\nexport default {\n data() {\n  return { count: 0 };\n },\n methods: {\n  increment() {\n   this.count++;\n  },\n },\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter (Composition API):\n\n\n\nexport default {\n setup() {\n  const count = ref(0);\n  const increment = () = > count.value++;\n  return { count, increment };\n },\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n 3. Better TypeScript Integration\n\n\nThe Composition API was designed with TypeScript in mind, improving type inference and static analysis.\n\nExample with TypeScript:\n\n\n\nimport { ref } from 'vue';\n\nexport default {\n setup() {\n  const count = ref(0);\n\n  const increment = (): void = > {\n   count.value++;\n  };\n\n  return { count, increment };\n },\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n 4. Reduced Complexity in Large Applications\n\n\nWhen managing large components with multiple responsibilities, the Composition API simplifies code organization.\n\nExample: Separating Logic\n\n\n\nimport { ref, onMounted } from 'vue';\n\nexport function useFetchData(url) {\n const data = ref(null);\n const error = ref(null);\n\n onMounted(async () = > {\n  try {\n   const response = await fetch(url);\n   data.value = await response.json();\n  } catch (err) {\n   error.value = err;\n  }\n });\n\n return { data, error };\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Does the Composition API Improve Developer Experience?\n\n\n\n \n \n Advantages\n\n\n\n\nFlexibility: Organizing code by features rather than options improves readability and scalability.\n\nReusability: Composable functions enable logic sharing without the limitations of mixins or HOCs.\n\nTypeScript Friendliness: Native TypeScript support reduces type-related bugs.\n\n\n\n \n \n Challenges\n\n\n\n\nLearning Curve: Developers familiar with the Options API may face a steep learning curve.\n\nVerbosity: The setup function can become verbose in simple components compared to the Options API.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Comparison: Composition API vs. Options API\n\n\n\n\n\nFeature\nComposition API\nOptions API\n\n\n\n\nCode Organization\nOrganized by features\nOrganized by options\n\n\nReusability\nHighly reusable\nLimited to mixins/HOCs\n\n\nTypeScript Integration\nStrong support\nModerate support\n\n\nLearning Curve\nSteeper for new developers\nEasy to learn\n\n\nModularity\nExcellent\nModerate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Advanced Example: Fetching Data\n\n\nLet’s build a component that fetches and displays user data.\n\nReusable Hook:\n\n\n\nimport { ref } from 'vue';\n\nexport function useFetch(url) {\n const data = ref(null);\n const loading = ref(true);\n\n const fetchData = async () = > {\n  loading.value = true;\n  const response = await fetch(url);\n  data.value = await response.json();\n  loading.value = false;\n };\n\n fetchData();\n\n return { data, loading };\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComponent Using the Hook:\n\n\n\n\nimport { useFetch } from './useFetch';\n\nexport default {\n setup() {\n  const { data, loading } = useFetch('https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users');\n  return { data, loading };\n },\n};\n\n\n\n \n  Loading...\n  \n   {{ user.name }}\n  \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Conclusion\n\n\nThe Composition API is a game-changer for Vue developers, offering modularity, flexibility, and better TypeScript support. While it introduces a steeper learning curve, its long-term benefits in scalability and maintainability make it an invaluable tool for modern development.\n\nWhether you’re building small apps or scaling enterprise-level solutions, the Composition API equips you with the tools to write better, cleaner code.

      "contentSnippet": "A spinning VR gaming chair sounds like it would be an at-home vomitron. The virtual reality environment tends to make some people (like me) queasy as it is, so adding synchronized full-body rotation seems like a recipe for disaster. I was kind of prepared for the worst when I decided to try out the $800 Roto VR Explorer at CES 2025, which uses a head-tracker that attaches to the top of Meta Quest devices and other headsets to make a swivel chair turn in whatever direction you’re looking. But against all odds, I ended up having a pretty good time. \nIn addition to enhancing the experience of seated VR gaming, the chair is actually supposed to help with issues like motion sickness, because, according to the press materials, “the signals from your inner ear will match what your brain is expecting from the visual cues.” Still, I was a little nervous, and it didn’t help that as we approached the booth, the first thing we saw was an empty chair spinning on its own in the corner like an omen. \nThe Roto VR Explorer is a Made for Meta product, meaning it’s optimized for Quest, but it’ll work with standalone headsets like those in the HTC Vive family and “soon” the Apple Vision Pro. The chair itself weighs 66 pounds, so it felt really sturdy to sit in, and it has a rumble pack under the seat to bring haptic feedback to the rest of your body instead of just in your hands from the controllers. The head tracker, which looks like a flattened Poké Ball, clips onto the top strap of the headset. \nAfter the Roto team gave me the rundown and got me set up in the chair with a Quest 3, I selected my VR experience — the 2018 interactive documentary about the universe, Spheres — and got going. It was, without a doubt, a little weird at first when I turned my head to follow the path of rippling auroras and felt my body rotate as if I were a spice jar on a lazy Susan. But for the most part, it didn’t have that disorienting feeling of the ground shifting underneath you. (It was definitely lagging a bit on the congested show floor, which did lead to some out-of-sync, jerky movements). It only took a minute or so for me to stop focusing on the fact that I was in motion and just go with it. \n\n \n \n \n Jessica Conditt for Engadget\n \n \nFor something like Spheres, where you’re just sort of moseying through beautiful visuals and curiously interacting with the virtual environment, the Roto VR Explorer is actually really nice. If you’re in a faster-paced setting, like a first-person shooter, it’s only going to ramp up the tension. I tried turning my head quickly to the side back and forth a few times to see how it would work with that sort of movement, and it really goes when it’s running smoothly. The chair moves at max speed of 21 revolutions per minute, but you can reduce this with the controllers if that gets to be too much. \nI fully expected to be doing a lot of deep breathing to get through the demo, but there actually never was a point that I felt nauseated. And when I got up out of it and reentered real life, I didn’t feel any more wobbly-legged and confused than I usually do after spending time behind a headset (though I’m sure using it for a few hours straight would change that). I'm mostly just relieved I didn't throw up in front of a bunch of strangers.  \nThere are plenty of situations in which a person might want or need to do their VR gaming sitting down, and the Roto VR Explorer chair offers a pretty fun way to bring the immersion to another level. It’s available for purchase now, with upgrade packages — including Pro Flying and Pro Racing — expected to follow in August 2025. \n\n \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/this-spinning-vr-chair-at-ces-2025-somehow-didnt-make-me-feel-like-throwing-up-133040191.html?src=rss",

According to Bloomberg, the team is taking over the games and franchises of Private Division, a former Take-Two label that published indie games.\nA new enterprise that doesn't have a name as yet is said to have been formed and it appears that some of the remaining 20 or so employees of Private Division will be laid off as part of the transition. Take-Two said in November that it had sold Private Division (which published The Outer Worlds and physical copies of Hades) to an unnamed buyer, reportedly a private equity firm called Haveli Investments.\nHaveli is said to have brought in the former Annapurna employees in recent weeks and handed them the keys to Private Division's portfolio. That includes an upcoming cozy life sim based on The Lord of the Rings called Tales of the Shire, the Kerbal Space Program series and a new project from Game Freak, which is best known for making Pokémon games.\nThe entire Annapurna Interactive staff quit last summer after discussions to spin out the publisher from parent company Annapurna Pictures fell apart. The company then set out to replace the team.\nAnnapurna has a stellar track record in the indie realm, having published a string of highly regarded games such as Stray, Sayonara Wild Hearts, What Remains of Edith Finch, Cocoon and (slightly confusingly) Outer Wilds. So there’s reason for optimism that its former staffers can do great things with the Private Division portfolio. Fingers crossed that this also somehow portends a future for OlliOlli and the brilliant Rollerdrome. Both were developed by Roll7, a now-shuttered studio that was under Private Division’s umbrella.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/former-annapurna-interactive-staff-are-reportedly-taking-over-publisher-private-divisions-game-portfolio-133033714.html?src=rss",

      "contentSnippet": "Vue.js is one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks for building user interfaces. Known for its simplicity and flexibility, Vue.js makes it easy for developers to create dynamic, interactive applications. However, like any tool, Vue.js can sometimes cause unexpected bugs or issues, especially when you're working on large app development projects.\n\nDebugging these issues is crucial to making sure everything works smoothly. In this blog, we’ll cover practical, easy-to-follow tips for debugging Vue.js applications like a professional. These tips will help you get your application back on track quickly and efficiently.\n\n\n \n \n Why Debugging is Important in Vue.js\n\n\nBefore we dive into the tips, it’s helpful to understand why debugging is so important. Vue.js is a framework that lets you build dynamic web apps with ease. But just like any complex project, it’s common for errors or unexpected behaviors to appear while developing. Debugging helps you find and fix these issues before they affect your users.\n\nAs you work on your custom Vue.js web app development, debugging will be a key part of your day-to-day process. With the right tools and techniques, you can make sure your app runs as smoothly as possible.\n\n\n \n \n Use Vue DevTools to Inspect Your Application\n\n\nOne of the best tools to use when debugging a Vue.js web app is Vue DevTools. Vue DevTools is an official browser extension that lets you inspect and debug your Vue.js applications. It’s like a toolbox that gives you a detailed view of what’s happening inside your app.\n\nWith Vue DevTools, you can:\n\nInspect Components: View your component structure, including data, props, and events.\nMonitor Data Changes: See how your data changes over time, which can help identify issues.\nCheck Vuex State: Track the state management of your app, especially if you're using Vuex to manage the app’s data.\nIf you're hiring Vue developers or a Vue.js development company, make sure they know how to use Vue DevTools effectively. It's a game-changer when debugging.\n\n\n \n \n Leverage Console Logs for Simple Debugging\n\n\nWhen you’re stuck on a problem, sometimes the best way to understand what's going wrong is by logging information to the console. A simple console.log() statement can show you exactly what's happening at any given point in your application.\n\nHere are a few ways you can use console logs effectively:\n\nTrack Function Calls: If you’re not sure if a function is running when it should, add a console log at the beginning of that function.\nInspect Data Changes: Whenever your data changes, log it to the console. This can help you see if the right values are being passed around in your app.\nJust remember to remove unnecessary console logs before deploying to production. While they’re helpful for debugging during development, they can slow down your app if left in place.\n\n\n \n \n Validate Your Props and Data\n\n\nSometimes, problems in Vue.js apps happen because data is passed incorrectly between components. One of the easiest ways to prevent this is by validating your props.\n\nIn Vue, you can define the expected type and requirements for props. If the wrong type of data is passed, Vue will show you a warning, making it easy to spot potential issues.\n\n\n \n \n Use Source Maps for Easier Debugging in Production\n\n\nWhen you're working on a production build of your Vue.js web app, your JavaScript code is often minified to reduce its size. This can make it harder to debug, because the minified code is hard to read.\n\nTo solve this problem, use source maps. Source maps allow you to map your minified code back to the original, readable version. This makes it much easier to trace and fix bugs in production. It’s an essential tool for any serious developer.\n\nMake sure to enable source maps in your production environment. This way, you’ll always have access to readable code, no matter where you're debugging.\n\n\n \n \n Break Your App into Smaller Components\n\n\nA major advantage of Vue.js is its component-based architecture. When you break your app into small, reusable components, it’s much easier to manage and debug.\n\nBy isolating issues to specific components, you can quickly determine where things are going wrong. When a bug appears, try to narrow it down to a specific component. Test that component on its own to see if the issue still occurs.\n\nUnit tests are especially helpful when you want to make sure individual components are working as expected. If you’re hire a Vue.js developer, ensure that they know how to write unit tests to catch issues early.\n\n\n \n \n Optimize for Performance to Avoid Bugs\n\n\nSometimes, bugs aren't the result of code errors, but rather performance issues. If your Vue.js web app is too slow, users might experience glitches or crashes.\n\nTo avoid performance problems, use the browser’s performance tools to analyze your app’s behavior. Look for long load times, heavy rendering, and unoptimized API calls.\n\nVue.js also provides performance profiling tools in Vue DevTools. These tools let you track component re-renders and identify any bottlenecks that may be slowing down your app.\n\n\n \n \n Keep Dependencies Up to Date\n\n\nVue.js apps often rely on third-party libraries and dependencies. If you’re using outdated libraries, they can cause bugs or even break your app.\n\nMake sure to keep all of your dependencies up to date. Use tools like npm audit to check for known vulnerabilities in your dependencies, and make sure everything is compatible with your version of Vue.js.\n\nIf you plan to hire Vue.js programmers for your team, ensure they understand the importance of managing dependencies. Outdated libraries can cause subtle bugs that are hard to track down.\n\n\n \n \n Set Up Error Boundaries to Catch Errors in Components\n\n\nErrors can happen in Vue.js components, and sometimes those errors can crash your entire app. To prevent this, you can use error boundaries.\n\nError boundaries allow you to catch errors inside a specific component and handle them gracefully, without affecting the rest of the application. This feature is available in Vue 3 and can help prevent your whole app from crashing due to one small error.\n\n\n \n \n Debug Asynchronous Code Carefully\n\n\nAsynchronous code—like API calls or operations that use promises—can often be the source of tricky bugs. Since asynchronous code doesn't always run in the order you expect, it’s important to carefully track down any issues.\n\nUse tools like async stack traces to see exactly where problems are happening in your asynchronous code. Vue DevTools also lets you track asynchronous updates, which can help you see if the DOM updates after an async action.\n\n\n \n \n Keep Your Codebase Clean and Well-Documented\n\n\nA clean codebase makes debugging easier. When code is organized well, it’s much simpler to track down issues. Make sure your code is modular, with components and functions that each have a clear, single responsibility.\n\nWell-documented code is also easier to debug. When you write clear comments and explanations, it’s easier for other developers—or even yourself in the future—to understand how things work and spot potential issues.\n\n\n \n \n Test Your Application in Multiple Environments\n\n\nFinally, always test your application in different environments. Your app might work perfectly on your local machine but behave differently on other devices or browsers.\n\nMake sure to test your Vue.js web app on various platforms to ensure cross-browser compatibility. If you're working on a complex project, consider using automated testing tools to check for potential issues in different environments.\n\n\n \n \n Conclusion\n\n\nDebugging is an essential part of Vue.js development. By using tools like Vue DevTools, validating props, and testing components in isolation, you can quickly find and fix problems in your app. It’s also important to keep your code clean, monitor performance, and stay on top of third-party dependencies.\n\nWhether you're working on a Vue.js web app or planning to hire Vue.js app developers for a new project, these tips will help ensure that your app runs smoothly and efficiently. Debugging doesn't have to be a frustrating task. With the right approach, you'll be able to handle it like a pro.\n\n\n \n \n FAQs\n\n\nWhat is Vue DevTools, and how does it help with debugging?\nVue DevTools is a browser extension that helps you inspect and debug Vue.js applications. It lets you view component structures, monitor data changes, and track Vuex state changes, making debugging much easier.\n\nHow can I hire dedicated Vue.js developers for my project?\nLook for developers who have strong experience with Vue.js and a good understanding of debugging techniques.

      "contentSnippet": "In summer 2023, the Biden administration announced its plan to certify devices with a logo indicating powerful cybersecurity. Now, as Biden navigates his last couple weeks in office, the White House has launched the US Cyber Trust Mark. The green shield logo will adorn any product which passes accreditation tests established by the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST). \nThe program will open to companies \"soon,\" allowing them to submit products to an accredited lab for compliance testing. \"The US Cyber Trust Mark embodies public-private collaboration,\" the White House stated in a release. \"It connects companies, consumers, and the US government by incentivizing companies to build products securely against established security standards and gives consumers an added measure of assurance — through the label — that their smart device is cybersafe.\" Some companies, like Best Buy and Amazon, plan to showcase labeled products for consumer's easy discovery.\nSteps to get the program up and running have continued over the last year and a half. In March, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the program in a bipartisan, unanimous vote. Last month, the Commission issued 11 companies with conditional approval to act as Cybersecurity Label Administrators. \nThe White House's original announcement included plans to also create a QR code linking to a database of the products — its unclear if this aspect will move forward. The QR code would allow customers to check if the product was up-to-date with its cybersecurity checks. This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/devices-with-strong-cybersecurity-can-now-apply-for-a-government-seal-of-approval-131553198.html?src=rss",

Samsung has a Galaxy Unpacked event in San Jose scheduled for January 22nd, when it is expected to unveil the Galaxy S25 series.",

      "contentSnippet": "RollAway combines the luxuries of a high-end hotel with the freedom of camping, all in a drivable, eco-friendly package. RollAway is a camper-van rental service that offers an on-demand concierge who can plan your trip, direct you along the way, provide tips about the best spots to visit, and keep your space equipped with five-star amenities. The van has a seating area that transforms into a queen bed, a kitchen with a sink and dual-burner stovetop, a shower, toilet, lots of storage, and a panoramic roof. When the van’s rear rolling door is pulled down, it acts as a screen for the included projector. \nBut that’s just all the built-in stuff. RollAway also comes with a lineup of top-tier amenities, including Yeti coolers and cups, Starlink satellite Wi-Fi, locally sourced breakfast packages, Malin+Goetz toiletries, fresh linens, and a tablet loaded with hospitality services. The tablet gives you access to a live virtual concierge and the Hospitality On-Demand app, which houses your itinerary, room service and housekeeping requests. In the future, RollAway will offer a full housekeeping service, but that feature isn’t live quite yet. \n\n \n \n \n RollAway\n \n \nBest of all, RollAway is a sustainability-focused, zero-emissions endeavor. The vans are fully electric, courtesy of GM’s EV subsidiary BrightDrop, and they have a single-charge range of more than 270 miles. They also have a fast charging option. The vans have solar panels, a waterless toilet, and low-waste water systems for serious off-grid trips, or they can be fully hooked up at RV sites. \nWe took a quick tour of a RollAway van at CES 2025 and found it to be as luxurious as advertised. The kitchen table slides into the seating area when it’s not in use, creating a fairly open hangout space at the very back of the van. The kitchen felt plenty large for camping purposes, and the most cramped space was the bathroom, which held a toilet and a sliver of a hand-washing sink. All of the finishing touches seemed sturdy and looked sleek. We were deeply tempted to drive right off the show floor in the thing. \n\n \n \n \n Engadget\n \n \nRollAway just started booking trips in late 2024, and the service is almost fully reserved throughout 2025. Reservations cost around $400 a night. It’s available only in the San Francisco Bay Area for now, but more cities are coming soon. RollAway had a successful funding round on Indiegogo in 2023, raising more than $47,000 of a $20,000 goal. \n\n \nThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/rollaway-is-a-rentable-ev-camper-van-with-a-concierge-service-and-luxury-amenities-130025021.html?src=rss",

      "contentSnippet": "I tracked down the Bosch 100 Series fridge at CES. It’s the company’s first to support the Matter standard, enabling local connectivity to any smart home ecosystem. | Photo by Eelco Lammertink for The Verge\n  \n\n Home appliance manufacturer Bosch is showing off its first Matter-enabled appliance on the show floor at CES this week. The 100 Series Frech Door Bottom Mount Refrigerator launched in November and should be available to buy in the US this spring. \nThe fridge retails for $2,500 and has a chip on board that supports Matter. A firmware update to the smart home standard will come this summer, says Eelco Lammertink of BSH, which owns Bosch, Siemens, Thermador, and Gaggenau.\nThe 100 series is the sister product to the Matter-enabled Siemens XXL Fridge I spotted at IFA in Berlin last November. That built-in model will come to the European market on a similar timeline. Lammertink tells me BSH plans to bring Matter to all its appliances across its Bosch, Siemens, and Thermador lines, starting with refrigerators this year, one more appliance category next year, and three in 2026.\n\n    \n   Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n   This Bosch fridge will work with Samsung SmartThings and Amazon Alexa this year. Bosch was demoing the integrations at CES via a SmartThings map view on the screen behind it and an Echo Show on the table.\n \nThe 100 Series will support Matter 1.3, allowing you to control the temperature remotely and receive notifications from the fridge on your smart home platform of choice. That way, a smart speaker can announce when the door has been left open, if you want. \nWhile many smart fridges already have these features, with Matter, the connection between the appliance and the ecosystem becomes local — making it faster and more secure. Currently, only Samsung SmartThings and Home Assistant support appliances in Matter, but Lammertink tells me that Amazon will support them this year. There is no word on Google Home or Apple Home yet.\nLammertink says the plan is to bring energy reporting and energy management capabilities to the fridge. This would enable it to be part of a Matter-enabled whole home energy management system. Sadly, he said they won't be updating existing appliances to Matter (bad news for my Thermoador range and dishwasher.) “The challenges are too big,” he said. “We just can't risk bricking your fridge.”",

      "contentSnippet": "Illustration: Alex Castro / The Verge\n  \n\n Washington state is suing T-Mobile for allegedly failing to address cybersecurity vulnerabilities that enabled a hacker to expose the personal data of 79 million people nationwide. The consumer protection lawsuit filed by Washington Attorney General Bob Ferguson on Monday stems from a cyberattack that began in March 2021 and went unnoticed until T-Mobile disclosed the breach in August.\nThe filing asserts that T-Mobile failed to address certain security vulnerabilities that the company was aware of “for years,” and did not properly notify more than two million Washington residents who were impacted by the breach. The lawsuit accuses T-Mobile of downplaying the severity of the breach, which exposed the personal information of current, former, and prospective customers — including their names, phone numbers, physical addresses, dates of birth, Social Security numbers, and driver’s license / ID numbers.\nThe notifications that T-Mobile issued about the data breach violated the Consumer Protections Act by omitting key information that made it difficult for people to assess if they were at risk of identity theft or fraud, according to the filing. The lawsuit also says that T-Mobile “did not meet industry standards for cybersecurity” for years prior to the hack, and used “obvious passwords” to protect accounts that could access consumer information.\n“This significant data breach was entirely avoidable,” Ferguson said in a statement. “T-Mobile had years to fix key vulnerabilities in its cybersecurity systems — and it failed.”\nThis isn’t the first time that Washington state has taken action against T-Mobile, with Ferguson having successfully persuaded the company to make clear the limitations of its “no-contract” wireless service plan back in 2013.\nFerguson’s latest lawsuit is seeking compensation for customers impacted by the 2021 breach and a court order that would force T-Mobile to bring its cybersecurity practices in line with industry standards, alongside improving transparency and communication around future data breaches. This follows T-Mobile paying $350 million in 2022 to settle a class-action lawsuit stemming from the 2021 hack, and a further $15.75 million fine last year over an FCC investigation into its repeated cybersecurity incidents.",

      "contentSnippet": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang holding the Project Digits computer on stage at CES 2025. | Photo by Artur Widak / Anadolu via Getty Images\n  \n\n It’s long been rumored that Nvidia is planning to break into the consumer CPU market in 2025, and we may have already had our first look at its new processor.\nOn Monday at CES, the company unveiled Project Digits, a $3,000 personal AI supercomputer powered by a new GB10 Grace Blackwell Superchip. Reuters reports that yesterday Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang hinted to investors and analysts that there are bigger plans for the Arm-based CPU within that chip, co-developed with MediaTek.\n“You know, obviously we have plans,” Huang said during an investor presentation, referring to the new 20-core desktop CPU, but that he would “wait to tell you” what they are.\nCo-developer MediaTek has its own ambitions though, and Huang suggested that it may also bring the CPU to market, independent of Nvidia. “Now they could provide that to us, and they could keep that for themselves and serve the market. And so it was a great win-win,” Huang said.\n\n    \n   Image: Nvidia\n   Nvidia’s Project Digits AI computer, featuring a new 20-core Arm CPU.\n \nProject Digits itself isn’t a mass-market product, costing $3,000 and running on a custom Linux system designed specifically for AI developers. But Nvidia’s consumer CPU ambitions have been rumored since October 2023, when Reuters reported that the company, alongside rival AMD, was working on Arm-based chips to launch in 2025.\nQualcomm has currently cornered the market on Arm-based CPUs for Windows PCs, boosted by last year’s launch of the Snapdragon X Elite processors. Those chips provided the sort of performance and power efficiency previously only available with Apple’s MacBooks, and put real pressure on Intel and AMD’s x86 systems.\n2024 was the year that Windows on Arm finally achieved its potential, and with increased competition from Nvidia and others, 2025 could mark a turning point in the battle between x86 and Arm.",

      "contentSnippet": "Apple is still barred from selling iPhone 16 models in Indonesia despite agreeing to build a local production facility there, as it has not met domestic content rules, the country's industry minister said on Wednesday (via Reuters).\r\n\r\n\r\nIndonesia's minister of industry, Agus Gumiwang Kartasasmita, reportedly met with Apple's VP of global government affairs, Nick Ammann, on January 7 to discuss Apple's investment proposal. However, Agus later implied that the company's proposal was not yet adequate. \"If it is $1 billion, then that is not enough,\" he told reporters after the meeting.\r\n\r\nLast year, Indonesian authorities banned iPhone 16 sales after they determined Apple had failed to meet the country's requirement for 35% domestic content in smartphones. Apple has since offered a $1 billion investment in the country that includes building an AirTag factory. Apple's offer is a significant increase from its previous offers of $10 million and $100 million, which were rejected by the government.\r\n\r\nAgus confirmed Apple had agreed to build a facility producing AirTag tracking devices on Indonesia's Batam island, close to Singapore, but that still would not count as a locally-made iPhone part.\r\n\"There is no basis for the ministry to issue a local content certification as a way for Apple to have the permission to sell iPhone 16 because (the facility) has no direct relations,\" he said, adding the ministry would only count phone components.Indonesia's investment minister on Tuesday said the factory would start operations next year. The agreement will be seen as a success for President Prabowo's efforts to attract foreign investment while demonstrating the effectiveness of Indonesia's strategy to pressure international companies into developing products locally. The country remains a significant market for Apple, with over half of its 278 million residents under the age of 44.Tag: IndonesiaThis article, \"iPhone 16 Still Banned in Indonesia Despite $1B Apple Investment Deal\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "link": "https://www.csoonline.com/article/567531/the-biggest-data-breach-fines-penalties-and-settlements-so-far.html",
      "contentSnippet": "Sizable fines assessed for data breaches in recent years suggest that regulators are getting more serious about cracking down on organizations that don’t properly protect consumer data.\n\n\n\nHit with a $ 1.3 billion fine for unlawfully transferring personal data from the European Union to the US, Meta tops the list of recent big-ticket sanctions, with one other ten figure fine being levied against the Chinese firm Didi Global for violating that nation’s data protection laws. The third largest penalty was the $877 million fine against Amazon in 2021 for running afoul of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe.\n\n\n\nHere are the biggest fines and penalties assessed for data breaches or non-compliance with security and privacy laws.\n\n\n\n1. Meta (Facebook) : $1.3 Billion\n\n\n\nIn May 2023, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) concluded an enquiry into Meta Platform Ireland Limited (“Meta Ireland”) it had initiated in Aug 2020, billing the social media giant €1.2 billion ($1.3 billion) for violation of the GDPR. With regards to the article 46(1) of the GDPR, the Irish privacy watchdog blamed Meta Ireland for the transfer of personal data from the EU or the European Economic Area (EEA) to the US without adequate data privacy safeguards in connection with the delivery of its Facebook services. Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, said, “We intend to appeal both the decision’s substance and its orders including the fine, and will seek a stay through the courts to pause the implementation deadlines.”\n\n\n\n2. Didi Global: $1.19 billion\n\n\n\nChinese ride-hailing firm Didi Global was fined 8.026 billion yuan ($1.19 billion) by the Cyberspace Administration of China after it decided that the company violated the nations’ network security law, data security law, and personal information protection law. In a statement, Didi Global said it accepted the cybersecurity regulators’ decision, which came after a year-long investigation into the firm over its security practices and “suspected illegal activities.”\n\n\n\n3. Amazon: $877 million\n\n\n\nIn summer 2021, retail giant Amazon’s financial records revealed that officials in Luxembourg issued a €746 million (then $877 million) fine for breaches of the GDPR. Amazon was expected to be appeal the fine, with a spokesperson stating, “There has been no data breach, and no customer data has been exposed to any third party.” La Quadrature du Net, the French digital rights organization that filed the original data protection complaint against Amazon on behalf of 10,065 individual complainants in May 2018, said that was unsurprising, since its 19-page complaint targeted Amazon’s operation of a behavioral advertising system without adequate consent, and not an intermittent leak of personal data.\n\n\n\n4. Equifax: (At least) $575 Million\n\n\n\n2017 saw Equifax lose the personal and financial information of nearly 150 million people due to an unpatched Apache Struts framework in one of its databases. The company had failed to fix a critical vulnerability months after a patch had been issued and then failed to inform the public of the breach for weeks after it been discovered. \n\n\n\nIn July 2019 the credit agency agreed to pay $575 million — potentially rising to $700 million — in a settlement with the Federal Trade Commission, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), and all 50 U.S. states and territories over the company’s “failure to take reasonable steps to secure its network.” \n\n\n\n$300 million of that will go to a fund providing affected consumers with credit monitoring services (another $125 million will be added if the initial payment is not enough to compensate consumers), $175 million will go to 48 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico, and $100 million will go to the CFPB. The settlement also requires the company to obtain third-party assessments of its information security program every two years.\n\n\n\n“Companies that profit from personal information have an extra responsibility to protect and secure that data,” said FTC Chairman Joe Simons. “Equifax failed to take basic steps that may have prevented the breach that affected approximately 147 million consumers.”\n\n\n\nEquifax had already been fined £500,000 [~$625,000]  in the UK for the 2017 breach, which was the maximum fine allowed under the pre-GDPR Data Protection Act 1998.\n\n\n\nIn 2020, Equifax was made to pay further settlements relating to the breach: $7.75 million (plus $2 million in legal fees) to financial institutions in the US plus $18.2 million and $19.5 million to the states of Massachusetts and Indiana respectively. \n\n\n\n5. Meta (Facebook, Instagram): $ 413 million\n\n\n\nConcluding two enquiries made into Meta’s data processing operations in the European regions, commencing on the day GDPR came into operations (25 May, 2018), the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) announced in January 2023 that it found Meta platforms in breach of the GDPR “in connection with the delivery of its Facebook and Instagram services”. Meta Ireland was fined €210 million ($ 225 million) , for Facebook violations, and and €180 million ($ 193 million) for Instagram violations.\n\n\n\nMeta’s data processing operations with regards to Facebook and Instagram services were found in violations of several articles of the GDPR, including 5 (1) a) , 6 (1), 12 , and 13 (1) c), relating to the breach of transparency and information obligations.\n\n\n\n6. Instagram: $403 million\n\n\n\nIn September 2022, Ireland’s Data Protection Commissioner (DPC) fined Instagram for violating children’s privacy under the terms of the GDPR. The long-running complaint concerned data belonging to minors, particularly phone numbers and email addresses, which was made more public when some young users upgraded their profiles to business accounts to access analytics tools such as profile visits.\n\n\n\nInstagram’s owner, Meta, said it planned to appeal against the decision. “This inquiry focused on old settings that we updated over a year ago and we’ve since released many new features to help keep teens safe and their information private,” a Meta official told BBC News. “While we’ve engaged fully with the DPC throughout their inquiry, we disagree with how this fine was calculated and intend to appeal it.”\n\n\n\nAndy Burrows, child-safety-online policy head at the National Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children (NSPCC) said, “This was a major breach that had significant safeguarding implications and the potential to cause real harm to children using Instagram. The ruling demonstrates how effective enforcement can protect children on social media and underlines how regulation is already making children safer online.”\n\n\n\n7. TikTok: €345 million ($370 million)\n\n\n\nIn September 2023, TikTok was handed a €345 million ($370 million) fine by the Irish Data Protection Commission (DPC) for violating children’s data privacy, under GDPR law. The DPC found that TikTok had not been transparent enough with children about its privacy settings, and raised questions about how their data was processed.\n\n\n\nThe inquiry sought to examine the extent to which, during the period between July 31 2020 and December 31 2020, TikTok complied with its obligations under the GDPR in relation to its processing of personal data relating to child users of the TikTok platform in the context of:\n\n\n\n\nCertain TikTok platform settings, including public-by-default settings as well as the settings associated with the Family Pairing feature.\n\n\n\nAge verification as part of the registration process.\n\n\n\n\n“As part of the inquiry, the DPC also examined certain of TTL’s transparency obligations, including the extent of information provided to child users in relation to default settings,” the IDC said. The DPC’s decision, which was adopted on September 1, 2023, recorded findings of infringement of Articles 5(1)(c), 5(1)(f), 24(1), 25(1), 25(2), 12(1), 13(1)(e) and 5(1)(a) GDPR, relating to a range of matters including data security, data protection by design, and data processing.\n\n\n\nA spokesperson for the social media firm told media outlets, “We respectfully disagree with the decision, particularly the level of the fine imposed.”\n\n\n\n8. T-Mobile: $350 million\n\n\n\nIn July 2022, mobile communications giant T-Mobile announced the terms of a settlement for a consolidated class action lawsuit following a data breach that occurred in early 2021, impacting an estimated 77 million people. The incident centered around “unauthorized access” to T-Mobile’s systems after a portion of customer data was listed for sale on a known cybercriminal forum. In an SEC filing, it was revealed that T-Mobile would pay an aggregate of $350 million to fund claims submitted by class members, the legal fees of plaintiffs’ counsel, and the costs of administering the settlement. The company would also commit to an aggregate incremental spend of $150 million for data security and related technology in 2022 and 2023.\n\n\n\n“The company anticipates that, upon court approval, the settlement will provide a full release of all claims arising out of the cyberattack by class members, who do not opt-out, against all defendants, including the company, its subsidiaries and affiliates, and its directors and officers,” the filing read. “The settlement contains no admission of liability, wrongdoing or responsibility by any of the defendants. Class members consist of all individuals whose personal information was compromised in the breach, subject to certain exceptions set forth in the agreement. The company believes that terms of the proposed settlement are in line with other settlements of similar types of claims,” it added.\n\n\n\n9. LinkedIn: €310 Million ($335 Million)\n\n\n\nIn October 2024, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) fined LinkedIn €310 million ($335 million) for processing user data without proper consent, violating the GDPR. The Microsoft-owned platform used members’ personal information for behavioral analysis and targeted advertising without obtaining transparent, informed, or unambiguous consent. This fine is among the largest levied against a tech company for GDPR violations. LinkedIn plans to revise its ad practices to comply with the DPC’s demands, despite asserting its belief that it has complied with the regulation.\n\n\n\n10. Meta (Facebook): $277 million\n\n\n\nIn November 2022, the Ireland Data Protection Commission (DPC) fined Meta $277 million (€265 million) for the compromise of 500 million users’ personal information. The DPC started its inquiry on April 14, 2021, following reports of a collated data set of Facebook personal data that had been made available on the internet. \n\n\n\nThe scope of the inquiry concerned an examination and assessment of Facebook Search, Facebook Messenger Contact Importer, and Instagram Contact Importer tools in relation to the processing carried out by Meta Platforms Ireland Limited (“MPIL”) during the period between May 25, 2018, and September 2019. \n\n\n\n“The material issues in this inquiry concerned questions of compliance with the GDPR obligation for Data Protection by Design and Default,” the DPC wrote. “The DPC examined the implementation of technical and organizational measures pursuant to Article 25 GDPR (which deals with this concept). There was a comprehensive inquiry process, including cooperation with all of the other data protection supervisory authorities within the EU. Those supervisory authorities agreed with the decision of the DPC.”\n\n\n\nThe decision imposed a reprimand and an order requiring MPIL to bring its processing into compliance by taking a range of specified remedial actions within a particular timeframe.\n\n\n\n11. Meta (Facebook): $263.5 Million\n\n\n\nIn September 2024, Ireland’s Data Protection Commission (DPC) fined Meta €251 million ($263.5 million) for a 2018 Facebook breach that exposed the personal data of 29 million users. The breach, caused by a flaw in the “view as” feature, compromised sensitive information such as names, contact details, and locations. \n\n\n\nDespite addressing the issue and reporting it, Meta faced GDPR violations, contributing to a growing total of over $3 billion in fines. Meta plans to appeal the fine, citing the steps it has taken to enhance user data protection since the incident.\n\n\n\n12. Meta (WhatsApp:) $255 million\n\n\n\nFacebook-owned messaging service WhatsApp was fined €225 million ($255 million) in August 2021 for a series of GDPR cross-border data protection infringements in Ireland. The fine followed a lengthy investigation and enforcement process which began in 2018 and involved the Data Protection Commission’s proposed decision and sanctions being rejected by its counterpart European data protection regulators, resulting in a referral to and ruling from the European Data Protection Board. \n\n\n\nAllegations focused on complaints from users and non-users of WhatsApp’s services, involving alleged breaches of transparency and data subject information obligations under articles 12, 13, and 14 of the GDPR.\n\n\n\n13. Home Depot: ~$200 million\n\n\n\nIn 2014 Home Depot was involved in one of the largest data breaches to date involving a point-of-sale (POS) system, leading to a number of fines and settlements being paid. Stolen credentials from a third party enabled attackers to enter Home Depot’s network, elevate privileges, and eventually compromise the POS system. More than 50 million credit card numbers and 53 million email addresses were stolen over a five-month period between April and September 2014.\n\n\n\nHome Depot has reportedly paid out at least $134.5 million to credit card companies and banks as a result of the breach. In addition, in 2016 Home Depot agreed to pay $19.5 million to customers that had been affected by the breach, which included the cost of credit monitoring services to breach victims. In 2017 the firm agreed to pay an additional $25 million to the financial institutions affected by the breach that could be claimed by victims and cover banks’ losses.\n\n\n\nBreaches can have a longtail of costs, especially when it comes to fines and settlements. In November 2020, the retailer paid a further $17.5 million settlement to 46 US states and Washington DC for the breach. The agreement also compels Home Depot to employ a highly qualified CISO, provide security training for key personnel, and ensure security controls and policies in areas like identity and access, monitoring, and incident response.\n\n\n\n14. Capital One: $190 million\n\n\n\nIn December 2021, Capital One agreed to pay $190 million to settle a class-action lawsuit filed against it by U.S. customers over a 2019 data breach that affected 100 million people. This settlement comes more than a year after the U.S. Office of the Comptroller of the Currency fined Capital One $80 million for the same breach (see below).\n\n\n\nA software engineer at AWS was behind the attack, which exposed information including bank account details. “While Capital One and AWS deny all liability, in the interest of avoiding the time, expense and uncertainty of continued litigation, plaintiffs and Capital One have executed a term sheet containing the essential terms of a class settlement that, if approved by this court, will fully resolve all claims brought by plaintiffs,” a filing with the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia read. In an emailed statement, Capital One said that key facts in the case had not changed since it announced the event in coordination with federal authorities more than two years ago, with the hacker arrested and the stolen data recovered before it could be disseminated or used for fraudulent purposes. “We are pleased to have reached an agreement that will resolve the consumer class litigation in the U.S.,” the company added.\n\n\n\n15. Uber: $148 million\n\n\n\nIn 2016 ride-hailing app Uber had 600,000 driver and 57 million user accounts breached. Instead of reporting the incident, the company paid the perpetrator $100,000 to keep the hack under wraps. Those actions, however, cost the company dearly. The company was fined $148 million in 2018 — the biggest data breach fine in history at the time — for violation of state data breach notification laws.\n\n\n\n16. Morgan Stanley: $120 million (total)\n\n\n\nIn January 2022, investment bank and financial services giant Morgan Stanley agreed to pay $60 million to settle a legal claim relating to its data security. The agreement, if approved by a federal judge in Manhattan, will resolve a class-action lawsuit was that filed against the company in July 2020 regarding two security breaches that compromised the personal data of approximately 15 million customers. According to claimants, Morgan Stanley failed to protect the personally identifiable information (PII) of current and former clients. It is alleged data center equipment decommissioned by the firm in 2016 and 2019 was not efficiently wiped clean and a software flaw meant that unencrypted, sensitive data was visible to whoever purchased the equipment.\n\n\n\nThe proposed claim settlement comes more than a year after Morgan Stanley was handed a separate $60 million civil penalty by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC) in relation to the same incidents. The OCC stated that Morgan Stanley failed “to exercise proper oversight of the 2016 decommissioning of two Wealth Management business data centers located in the U.S. Among other things, the banks failed to effectively assess or address risks associated with decommissioning its hardware; failed to adequately assess the risk of subcontracting the decommissioning work, including exercising adequate due diligence in selecting a vendor and monitoring its performance; and failed to maintain appropriate inventory of customer data stored on the decommissioned hardware devices.” In 2019, the banks experienced similar vendor management control deficiencies in connection with decommissioning other network devices that also stored customer data, the OCC added.\n\n\n\nIn a statement on the recent settlement agreement, Morgan Stanley said: “We have previously notified all potentially impacted clients regarding these matters, which occurred several years ago, and are pleased to be resolving this related litigation.”\n\n\n\n17. Google Ireland: $102 million\n\n\n\nGoogle Ireland was hit by a €90 million ($102 million) fine by French data protection authority the CNIL on January 6, 2022. The fine related to how Google’s European arm implements cookie consent procedures on YouTube. “The CNIL has received many complaints about the way cookies can be refused on the websites google.fr and youtube.com,” it wrote. “In June 2021, the CNIL carried out an online investigation on these websites and found that, while they offer a button allowing immediate acceptance of cookies, the sites do not implement an equivalent solution (button or other) enabling the user to refuse the deposit of cookies equally easily. Several clicks are required to refuse all cookies, against a single one to accept them.” The restricted committee considered that this process affected the freedom of consent of internet users and constituted an infringement of Article 82 of the French Data Protection Act.\n\n\n\nEditor’s note: This article, originally published in July 2019, is frequently updated as new information on incident penalties becomes available.",

      "link": "https://www.csoonline.com/article/3625745/how-cisos-can-forge-the-best-relationships-for-cybersecurity-investment.html",
      "contentSnippet": "When it comes to securing cybersecurity investments there are many things at play. The key often lies in the CISO’s ability to build relationships with key stakeholders across the organization. However, CISOs are being tasked with protecting their organizations while navigating budget constraints.\n\n\n\nAlthough nearly two-thirds of CISOs report budget increases, funding is only up 8% on average this year. That’s much less than previous year’s growth, according to the IANS 2024 Security Budget Benchmark Summary report.\n\n\n\nWith budgets constrained, a CISO’s ability to secure sufficient funding depends on their influence and reputation within the organization. Fostering strong relationships with key business leaders is critical to securing their budget goals.\n\n\n\nFrom developers to the CFO: How to build trust\n\n\n\nErica Antos, CISO at TriNetX, places a premium on building strong cross-functional partnerships that not only advance security initiatives but also align with the business’s overall objectives. She identifies adjacent business functions as important partners for collaboration and alignment.\n\n\n\nIn her case, this involves understanding the priorities of the CFO, collaborating with legal to ensure data protection requirements are met, and working closely with IT and engineering to align security tools with broader organizational needs. “You want to understand what their goals are and identify some of the tools that security also uses that can help achieve both goals,” Antos says.\n\n\n\nFor example, a zero-trust solution will also help IT modernize network access and remove the need for a VPN. Privacy requirements can involve the general counsel and security through data protection. For this she advises talking with legal about what their needs are and if there are any tools that security can help with to achieve their objectives.\n\n\n\nIn other cases, it might involve engineering and working with developers and engaging with the CTO on things like code reviews or security alerts. “You can take a solution that security might use as a security event information management system that can also have a deployment that helps engineering teams,” she tells CSO.\n\n\n\nNaturally, building a good relationship with finance is crucial. This involves understanding their objectives and showing how security initiatives can help achieve those goals or provide cost savings.\n\n\n\n“It might not be aligning with finance to deploy some sort of a tool or get budget for something but showing efficiencies or how deploying certain tools can save X dollars,” Antos says.\n\n\n\nImpact of CISO’s reporting line on budget and relationships\n\n\n\nThe CISO’s proximity to certain stakeholders, based on their reporting line, can also affect their ability to align with key business leaders. Whether a CISO reports to the CFO, CIO, or directly to the CEO can influence how they prioritize and communicate security needs, and ultimately, how quickly they can gain buy-in for additional funding.\n\n\n\n“It can guide daily interactions that build the relationship, help them understand the needs of the group they’re a part of and be able to align more quickly,” says Antos.\n\n\n\nAntos believes it helps if it forces the CISO to understand the business side of how the organization works. “That’s thinking about efficiencies with a business hat as opposed to thinking with a purely technical hat,” she says.\n\n\n\nIn turn, applying a business mindset helps CISO achieve budget goals and greater satisfaction when day-to-day security operations are in sync with the strategic goals and priorities of leadership including the board. CISOs that lead security programs viewed in the context of business risk are more likely to be satisfied with their budget when this alignment is in place, according to the IANS report.\n\n\n\nHowever, in practice, CISOs can find themselves facing a critical paradox, according to Richard Watson, global and APAC cybersecurity consulting leader at EY. On one hand, the board can express a low appetite for cyber risk, but on the other hand, management might be saying there’s a need to cut a certain percentage from the budget. “These are almost irreconcilable positions, yet I see a number CISOs struggling with this paradox,” Watson says.\n\n\n\nWhile the CFO is a key stakeholder due to their budget management role, in these kinds of situations, Watson says it’s important for CISOs to highlight these contradictory objectives and look to natural allies to help build support for their budget.\n\n\n\nHe suggests that CISOs can spend time with the chair of the audit risk committee and explain the paradox because it’s not always visible to the board if management don’t declare they’re operating in a way that is constraining budgets. “If surfaced with the chair of the audit risk committee, it can help the CISO justify further budget increases, or why just staying flat and not cutting funds is a requirement,” he tells CSO.\n\n\n\nMaintain a visible profile within the broader organization\n\n\n\nCISOs satisfied with their budget typically have visibility and credibility with leadership, engage in risk management discussions, and present program metrics to the board, the IANS report noted. It suggests that CISOs must maintain a visible profile and engage within the broader organization and frame the conversation around business risk more than technical controls.\n\n\n\nWatson agrees that to successfully navigate influential, funding-related relationships, CISOs need visibility beyond the cyber and IT functions within the larger organization. “They may have started from technical beginnings, but to branch out beyond the IT department they need to be counted as a business partner and business advisor,” says Watson.\n\n\n\nAs Chris Peake, CISO at Smartsheet, points out, it’s not just about the CISO’s visibility — it’s about helping the organization understand the scope of cybersecurity threats it faces. The goal is to provide the context for making decisions around priorities and therefore funding and budget.\n\n\n\n“If security is going to be a business enabler, it’s visibility not just of the CISO and the security program; the threat landscape needs to be clear to everyone,” Peake says.\n\n\n\nThe CISO’s role is communicating this information broadly across the organization, including to the C-suite and board, and to align it with the overall business goals. “The rest of the business needs to understand what they’re up against and this helps them have the context for making decisions about what’s going to be prioritized,” Peake says.\n\n\n\nWhile it’s not always been a natural fit for CISOs to be fluent in finance, that’s changing as more conversations consider the financial aspects of the business. “Most of my peers are talking about budget and how we finance and think about bringing new technologies into the organization,” he says.\n\n\n\nNew technologies like generative AI, which open new threat vectors, are also triggering some budget conversations because they require investment to manage and secure. “They may require resources and that requires new perspectives in terms of how we deploy our existing tools,” he says.\n\n\n\nNonetheless, there will be situations that hinder budget decisions where CISOs face challenges in getting certain projects prioritized.\n\n\n\nNot having a relationship with a key stakeholder, or even having a contentious relationship can create barriers that otherwise wouldn’t be there, Antos says. “It can lead misunderstandings about what the security team is trying to do or lead to incorrect assumptions, misinterpretations or poor communications,” she says.\n\n\n\nThese can hinder budget allocation and lead to the solution or initiative falling off the priority list. It reinforces the importance of a shared understanding of the project’s importance. This requires constructive relationships and aligning priorities.\n\n\n\n“A lot of the time, what security does is implemented by other teams, like engineering, developers or IT, and so whatever it is you’re looking to implement, you’ll need to get it prioritized into their work queue,” she says.\n\n\n\nFinancial literacy underpins relationships that impact funding\n\n\n\nWith organizations facing financial headwinds, it puts more pressure on CISOs to justify their budget to stakeholders including the CFO, CEO, and the board, according to Watson. “In addition, new requirements for SEC disclosures are driving a big focus on cyber risk quantification because materiality has become really important,” he says.\n\n\n\nTo convincingly answer these challenges, CISOs need to tie cyber risk to budget and it’s why cyber risk quantification tools are becoming more important for them to build a robust business case.\n\n\n\n“How do you prove if something is material or not? You need to have a mathematical formula to do that. It’s the art and science cyber risk quantification is now gathering a lot of momentum in organizations,” he says.\n\n\n\nFor smaller organizations and those that don’t engage consulting firms, Antos suggests they utilize ISACA or IANS tools and resources to build out their risk analysis and budgeting processes. “These tools provide guidance and materials to help security teams develop the necessary financial literacy and budgeting processes internally,” she says.\n\n\n\nISACA’s Capability Maturity Model Integration (CMMI) framework helps with cost control and risk-based budgeting strategies. Organizations using the framework showed a 47% reduction in cost variance, according to the 2023 CMMI Technical Report.\n\n\n\nFor Antos, degrees in information systems and accounting have helped to bridge the technical and financial aspects of the CISO role. She emphasizes that understanding the language of finance and communicating the business value of security investments can significantly strengthen a CISO’s position when negotiating budgets.\n\n\n\nFor CISOs, financial literacy is no longer optional — it’s essential for engaging stakeholders and building the business case for security investments.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the budgeting process and communicating security’s business value allows CISOs to bridge the gap between technical requirements and organizational priorities, ensuring they get the resources they need.\n\n\n\nOn a practical level, having conversations about the needs of security, especially when it comes to big projects, needs to start early on and explain how it will impact the business.\n\n\n\n“Having all of that beforehand is a lot easier than trying to do it during the budgeting process,” she says.",

      "contentSnippet": "Während der Placebo-Effekt positive Erwartungshaltungen beschreibt, steht der Nocebo-Effekt für negative Erwartungen. Beides spielt bei den Security-Vorgaben eines Unternehmens bei den Mitarbeitenden eine große Rolle. Foto: kmls – shutterstock.comDer Placebo-Effekt basiert auf der Erwartungshaltung und der psychologischen Interpretation eines Menschen. Er spiegelt die Macht des Geistes wider, körperliche und mentale Zustände positiv zu beeinflussen. Forschungsergebnisse zeigen, dass das Gehirn bei der Freisetzung von Endorphinen und anderen chemischen Verbindungen aktiv involviert ist, die nachweislich zu einer verbesserten Wahrnehmung des Wohlbefindens führen können.Der Nocebo-Effekt ist der böse Bruder des Placebo-Effektes. Er beschreibt die Verschlechterung des Zustands einer Person aufgrund negativer Erwartungen oder Überzeugungen, auch wenn keine tatsächliche schädliche Komponente vorhanden ist. Ähnlich wie der Placebo-Effekt kann der Nocebo-Effekt zu realen physischen und psychischen Veränderungen führen. Negative Erwartungen können den Körper stressigen Situationen aussetzen, was zu unerwünschten Symptomen führen kann.Es gibt eine interessante Parallele zwischen dem Placebo- und dem Nocebo-Effekt im Kontext von Informationssicherheit, insbesondere wenn es darum geht, die Wahrnehmung und das Verhalten des Menschen in Bezug auf die Informationssicherheit zu gestalten.Sicherheitskonformes Verhalten fördern, aber wie?Um Veränderungen im Verhalten eines Menschen im Sinne der Informationssicherheit positiv zu beeinflussen, müssen wir zunächst die individuellen Überzeugungen und Einstellungen in Bezug auf das zu verändernde Verhalten verstehen. Wenn Personen beispielsweise überzeugt sind, dass starke Passwörter unerlässlich sind, um ihre beruflichen und persönlichen Informationen und Daten zu schützen, werden sie eher dazu neigen, komplexe Passwörter zu erstellen, Passwörter nicht zu teilen und möglichst häufig Zwei-Faktor-Authentifizierung (2FA) zu verwenden.Ein Beispiel, um die Wichtigkeit des Faktors Wissen zu verstehen, ist die Einführung des Sicherheitsgurtpflicht im Jahr 1976: Anfangs stieß diese Maßnahme auf erheblichen Widerstand, ähnlich wie manche Mitarbeitende möglicherweise zögern, Sicherheitsrichtlinien adäquat zu befolgen. Doch heute legt nahezu jeder instinktiv seinen Sicherheitsgurt an. Warum? Da Menschen sich sehr genau vorstellen können, was passiert, wenn sie ohne Sicherheitsgurt in einen Unfall mit hoher Geschwindigkeit verwickelt sind. Dies liegt daran, dass die Ursache – das Nichttragen des Sicherheitsgurts – nicht abstrakt, sondern äußerst greifbar und gut vorstellbar ist. Auf ähnliche Weise ist es entscheidend, dass wir in der Informationssicherheit die Mitarbeitenden durch Wissen in die Lage versetzen, die unmittelbaren Auswirkungen ihrer Handlungen zu erkennen. Wenn sie verstehen, dass das Klicken auf einen unsicheren Link oder das Öffnen einer fragwürdigen Datei zu schwerwiegenden Konsequenzen führen kann, sind sie eher bereit, die erforderlichen Sicherheitsmaßnahmen zu ergreifen. Aber das Dogma wäre unvollständig ohne die Fähigkeit oder das Können der Mitarbeitenden, die notwendigen Maßnahmen effektiv umzusetzen. Dies schließt persönliche, technische und organisatorische Fähigkeiten ebenso ein wie die Fähigkeit zur Risikoeinschätzung und -bewältigung.Lesetipp: Wie neue Mitarbeiter sicher Arbeiten – 7 Tipps für Ihr Security OnboardingWährend das Wissen und Können eine rationale Ebene darstellen, deren Verständnis und Umsetzung durch Fakten gestärkt werden können, erweist sich der Faktor Wollen als deutlich komplexer. Dies liegt vor allem daran, dass er maßgeblich von psychologischen Hintergründen und individuellen Eigenschaften beeinflusst wird. Placebo-Effekte im Kontext der Information Security AwarenessDie Schaffung eines positiven Sicherheitsumfelds ist von zentraler Bedeutung für die Informationssicherheit. Dies bedeutet auch sicherzustellen, dass die Bemühungen der Mitarbeitenden in diesem Segment geschätzt und anerkannt werden. Das kann durch Belohnungen, Anerkennung und eine unterstützende Unternehmenskultur erreicht werden, die das Engagement für Informationssicherheit fördert. Der Placebo-Effekt zeigt, dass die Erwartungen und Überzeugungen einer Person ihre Wahrnehmung und sogar ihre körperliche Reaktion beeinflussen können. In der Informationssicherheit bedeutet das, dass das Wissen und die Fähigkeiten der Mitarbeitenden in Verbindung mit ihren Erwartungen und Überzeugungen über die Wirksamkeit von Sicherheitsmaßnahmen einen erheblichen Einfluss auf ihr tatsächliches Verhalten haben. Insgesamt geht es darum, den Placebo-Effekt als mächtige Strategie zur Förderung von sicherheitsbewusstem Verhalten zu nutzen. Indem Mitarbeitende als aktive Teilnehmer an der Stärkung der Informationssicherheit anerkannt werden, können Organisationen eine Umgebung schaffen, in der positive Überzeugungen und Erwartungen das Verhalten in Richtung eines umfassenden Sicherheitsbewusstseins beeinflussen. Dieser Ansatz stellt sicher, dass Mitarbeitende nicht nur als Schwachstellen, sondern als treibende Kraft für die Stärkung der Sicherheit angesehen werden.Lesetipp: Kriminelle Osint-Recherchen – So geraten Ihre Mitarbeiter ins VisierWenn Mitarbeitende davon überzeugt sind, dass ihre Sicherheitskenntnisse und -fähigkeiten sie befähigen, effektive Schritte als “Stütze der Informationssicherheit” zum Schutz der Organisation zu unternehmen, werden sie wahrscheinlicher bereit sein, sich aktiv an sicherheitsrelevanten Aktivitäten zu beteiligen.Ähnlich wie der Placebo-Effekt können positive Erwartungen die Bereitschaft steigern, sicherheitsrelevante Verhaltensweisen anzuwenden. Nocebo-Effekte im Kontext der Information Security AwarenessDer Nocebo-Effekt, der normalerweise als negativer Gegenpart zum Placebo-Effekt betrachtet wird, hat ebenfalls Relevanz im Kontext der Informationssicherheit. Dieser Effekt kann auftreten, wenn Mitarbeitende in einer Organisation ständig mit negativen Szenarien, Bedrohungsberichten und Angst vor Sicherheitsverletzungen konfrontiert werden. Die übermäßige Betonung von Schwachstellen, Bedrohungen und Risiken ohne angemessene Betonung positiver Sicherheitsmaßnahmen kann zu einer entmutigenden Umgebung führen, in der Mitarbeitende das Gefühl haben, machtlos gegenüber den Bedrohungen zu sein. Die Auswirkung ist vielfältig:Angst und Paralyse: Mitarbeitende könnten sich von der Informationsflut über Bedrohungen überwältigt fühlen und das Gefühl haben, dass sie nie in der Lage sein werden, alle potenziellen Risiken zu bewältigen. Dies könnte zu Angst und einer lähmenden Paralyse führen.Geringschätzung von Bemühungen: Wenn Mitarbeitende das Gefühl haben, dass ihre Bemühungen zur Informationssicherheit, angesichts vermeintlich unüberwindbarer Bedrohungen, ohnehin irrelevant sind, könnten sie möglicherweise das Interesse an sicherem Verhalten verlieren.Rückgang der Verhaltensabsicht: Der Nocebo-Effekt könnte die Verhaltensabsicht beeinflussen, da Mitarbeitende aufgrund der negativen Erwartungen möglicherweise weniger bereit sind, sicherheitsbewusstes Verhalten zu zeigen.Strategien zur Förderung von sicherheitsbewusstem VerhaltenIndem die positiven Aspekte der Sicherheitspraktiken betont werden, können Mitarbeitende dazu motiviert werden, proaktiv zur Informationssicherheit beizutragen. Um den Nocebo-Effekt zu mildern und eine positive Sicherheitskultur zu fördern, ist es wichtig, ein ausgewogenes Sicherheitsbewusstsein zu schaffen. Dafür können Sie auf folgende Maßnahmen zurückgreifen: Betonung positiver Aspekte: Es ist notwendig, die positiven Auswirkungen sicherheitsbewussten Verhaltens hervorzuheben und Mitarbeitenden aufzuzeigen, wie ihre Bemühungen die Organisation schützen und stärken.Empowerment und Schulung: Mitarbeitende sollten befähigt werden, ihre Fähigkeiten zur Identifizierung von Bedrohungen und zur Anwendung von Sicherheitsmaßnahmen zu entwickeln. Schulungen, Unterstützung, Simulationen und Notfallübungen können das Selbstvertrauen stärken und den Nocebo-Effekt abschwächen. Steigerung des Lerneffektes durch Gamification: Gamification in Informationssicherheitsschulungen hat sich als effektive Strategie erwiesen, um das Engagement der Mitarbeitenden zu steigern und sicherheitsbewusstes Verhalten zu fördern. Diese Methode nutzt Elemente aus Spielen, um Lerninhalte attraktiver, interaktiver und motivierender zu gestalten. Spielelemente wie Punkte, Belohnungen, Wettbewerbe und Fortschrittsanzeiger steigern das Engagement der Mitarbeitenden. Sie werden motiviert, aktiv am Lernprozess teilzunehmen und sich mit den Sicherheitsinhalten auseinanderzusetzen.Zudem spricht Gamification den intrinsischen Antrieb der Menschen an, sich Herausforderungen zu stellen und Ziele zu erreichen. Die Möglichkeit, Fortschritte zu verfolgen und Belohnungen zu erhalten, steigert die Motivation, sich mit den Sicherheitsthemen auseinanderzusetzen. Spiele sind zudem oft interaktiv und visuell ansprechend, wodurch Informationen auf eine Art präsentiert werden, die das Gedächtnis anspricht. Dies hilft, Aufmerksamkeit auf wichtige Sicherheitskonzepte zu lenken und die Informationen effektiver zu vermitteln. Dadurch sind Mitarbeitende eher in der Lage, das Gelernte zu behalten und in der Praxis anzuwenden.Darüber hinaus bieten Spiele oft eine sichere Umgebung, um Fehler zu machen und aus ihnen zu lernen. Mitarbeitende können in einem geschützten Umfeld Sicherheitsbedrohungen erkennen und bewältigen, bevor sie in der Realität auftreten. Die ständige Aktualisierung von Spielen, Herausforderungen und Belohnungen wird das Interesse der Mitarbeitenden aufrechterhalten, was zu langfristigen und nachhaltigen Lerneffekten führen kann.Es ist wichtig, Fähigkeiten realistisch darzustellen und gleichzeitig die positiven Fortschritte und Gesichtspunkte zu betonen und die Menschen dazu zu ermutigen, ihre Sichtweise und ihr Handeln optimistisch zu gestalten. Indem Organisationen den Nocebo-Effekt berücksichtigen und die Kommunikation und Schulungen entsprechend gestalten, können sie sicherstellen, dass Mitarbeitende nicht von Angst oder Resignation beeinflusst werden, sondern motiviert sind, einen positiven Beitrag zur Informationssicherheit zu leisten. Dies fördert ein Gleichgewicht zwischen Sensibilisierung und Empowerment und verhindert, dass der Nocebo-Effekt das Sicherheitsbewusstsein untergräbt. Die Verknüpfung des Placebo-Effekts mit Wissen und Fähigkeiten, Verhaltensabsicht und Salienz unterstreicht die Bedeutung, Menschen als Stützen der Informationssicherheit zu betrachten. Indem die positiven Aspekte der Sicherheitspraktiken betont werden, können Mitarbeitende dazu motiviert werden, proaktiv zur Informationssicherheit beizutragen. (bw)",

      "link": "https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338788/las-vegas-cybertruck-explosion-chatgpt-ai-search",
      "contentSnippet": "Image: LMVPD\n  \n\n Nearly a week after a New Year’s Day explosion in front of the Trump Hotel in Las Vegas, local law enforcement released more information about their investigation, including what they know so far about the role of generative AI in the incident. \nThey confirmed that the suspect, an active duty soldier in the US Army named Matthew Livelsberger, had a “possible manifesto” saved on his phone, in addition to an email to a podcaster and other letters. They also showed video evidence of him preparing for the explosion by pouring fuel onto the truck while stopped before driving to the hotel. He’d also kept a log of supposed surveillance, although the officials said he did not have a criminal record and was not being surveilled or investigated.\n\nThe Las Vegas Metro Police also released several slides showing questions he’d posed to ChatGPT several days before the explosion, asking about explosives, how to detonate them, and how to detonate them with a gunshot, as well as information about where to buy guns, explosive material, and fireworks legally along his route. \n\nAsked about the queries, OpenAI spokesperson Liz Bourgeois said:\nWe are saddened by this incident and committed to seeing AI tools used responsibly. Our models are designed to refuse harmful instructions and minimize harmful content. In this case, ChatGPT responded with information already publicly available on the internet and provided warnings against harmful or illegal activities. We’re working with law enforcement to support their investigation.\nThe officials say they are still examining possible sources for the explosion, described as a deflagration that traveled rather slowly as opposed to a high explosives detonation that would’ve moved faster and caused more damage. While investigators say they haven’t ruled out other possibilities like an electrical short yet, an explanation that matches some of the queries and the available evidence is that the muzzle flash of a gunshot ignited fuel vapor/fireworks fuses inside the truck, which then caused a larger explosion of fireworks and other explosive materials.\nTrying the queries in ChatGPT today still works, however, the information he requested doesn’t appear to be restricted and could be obtained by most search methods. Still, the suspect’s use of a generative AI tool and the investigators’ ability to track those requests and present them as evidence take questions about AI chatbot guardrails, safety, and privacy out of the hypothetical realm and into our reality.",

      "link": "https://www.biometricupdate.com/202501/biometric-transactions-to-generate-315b-by-2028-prism-project",
      "contentSnippet": "The boom in biometrics as the only reliable link between humans and their digital identities and data will continue through the next several years, according to the projects of The Prism Project from Acuity Market Intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe Project’s Biometric Digital Identity Flagship Report has been released to help guide vendors and relying parties through the complexity of an ecosystem in which maturity is seen not in zero-sum tabulation of market winners and losers,  but a diversity of technologies and approaches to deal with a wide range of specific problems and applications.\r\n\r\n“This is the thing we’re really trying to address with the Prism: how do these things fit together? Because if we don’t explain how they fit together, then everyone thinks ‘I just need this’ or ‘I just need that,’” Acuity Principal Maxine Most tells Biometric Update in an interview.\r\n\r\nShe traces this thinking back, at least in part, to years of messaging from identity and access management (IAM) vendors telling prospective customers that single sign-on (SSO) or federated identity could solve all of their identity-related challenges.\r\n\r\nTrends in user experience, regulatory compliance and fraud mitigation are pushing the adoption of biometrics, and growing the market towards revenues of $315 billion and 5.6 trillion transactions between 2024 and 2028. The jump in revenue represents a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.5 percent.\r\n\r\nDespite this growth, Acuity identifies a disparity between how vendors see automation driving demand, and how relying parties are prioritizing compliance and customer experience.\r\n\r\nMost urges vendors to listen carefully to their customers, and recounts a conversation with a compliance manager at a major relying party who said they simply could not use some of the technology being offered to them. “It’s always that balance between innovation and actually listening to customers,” she says.\r\n\r\nThat often means pitching technology that can help reduce fraud from the perspective of user experience. “You start with that customer experience because that’s what’s going to drive the high levels of use that are going to make it valuable.”\r\nUnderstanding the market\r\nBroadly speaking, the most widely adopted applications are authentication, user onboarding and access control, with relatively minimal interest in employee time and attendance, according to the Flagship Report.\r\n\r\nThe Report sets out the market position of 250 biometrics and digital identity vendors and organizations. Most emphasizes that although the reports have dozens of sponsoring vendors, they are a product of collaboration and broad consultation with players on both sides of the market, not “pay-to-play.”\r\n\r\nIdemia, SITA and Mastercard sit in the middle of the Flagship Prism, as Identity Titans. Around them organizations are grouped into different categories as providers of Biometric Core Tech, Identity Platforms, Solutions Providers, Authentication, Identity Proofing and Verification, Decentralized Identity, Infrastructure and Relying Parties.\r\n\r\nThe inclusion of the infrastructure and relying party beams of the prism is reflective of the influence they have in a biometrics marketplace that has already advanced from the initial adoptions driven by innovation to the doorstep of mainstream use.\r\n\r\n“Without all of that core infrastructure, you can’t have a mature marketplace,” Most points out.\r\n\r\nThe Prism is “a living research document,” and as such Most says that when Acuity was putting together the Travel and Hospitality Report, the importance of the decisions being made by the relying parties necessitated their inclusion.\r\n\r\nEach of the Prism reports presents market players in each category as Luminaries, Catalysts or Pulsars. Luminaries are the leaders in their field, the most proficient in their application and often the organizations that set trends. Catalysts are established but attempting to rise to the Liminary category through disruption, innovation and acceleration. Pulsars are “bright upstarts and pivoting legacy vendors” with potential.\r\n\r\nHelping people understand how they fit together, Most says, is the fundamental purpose of the reports.\r\n\r\n“There are different types of identity transactions and interactions, and you don’t need the same technology for all of them, and that’s okay. What problem are you trying to solve, and what are the pieces.”\r\n\r\nThe report also breaks down the market by region and vertical.\r\n\r\nFinancial Services, Travel and Hospitality and Government Services Prism Reports preceded the release of the Flagship report.\r\n\r\nGovernment services, including civil identity, healthcare, social services and border control will generate $202.5 billion in revenue for biometrics and digital identity vendors supporting 6.4 trillion identity transactions from 2024 to 2028, according to Acuity.\r\n\r\nThe Travel and Hospitality Prism Report forecasts a 92 percent CAGR and 263 billion biometrics-enabled transactions the industry yielding $72 billion in revenue globally over the same period.\r\n\r\nFinancial services, perhaps surprisingly, make up the smallest of the three segments, with $40 billion in revenue forecast between 2024 and 2028, according to a Prism Report released in June.\r\n\r\nFor 2025, the Prism Reports will shift to a focus on the pressing issues and challenges facing the biometrics and digital identity industry.",

      "contentSnippet": "In a bold move to keep Trust Stamp solvent, the Atlanta face biometrics and digital ID firm has announced “a strategic transaction with Houston-based Qenta Inc.,” a fintech platform that offers “asset tokenization, cashless payments, and capital and risk management solutions,” according to a release.\r\n\r\nThe deal alleviates some of the financial pressures on Trust Stamp, which, late in 2024, expressed concern about its ability to continue operations for long without an influx of cash.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement will see Trust Stamp claim a 10 percent ownership interest in QID Technologies LLC (QID), a new subsidiary spun off from Qenta’s Goldstar KYC technology.\r\n\r\nAs well, Trust Stamp is providing a non-exclusive license of its AI-equipped identity and liveness tech to QID in return for “a single $1 million license fee receivable in three installments over Q1 of 2025.”\r\n\r\nIn other words, immediate financial relief.\r\n\r\nIf that weren’t enough, QID is also effectively putting Trust Stamp on retainer. The deal specifies that QID is contracting Trust Stamp for “business development, product development, and product operations for identity and privacy services and solutions in return for monthly service fees starting January 1st, 2025, and capped at $3.6 million annually.”\r\n\r\nIts ownership stake means the projected annual take would hash out into a net cash inflow of $3.3 million. Given the annual cap and the equity stake, there is clear potential for that to translate into a yearly influx for Trust Stamp.\r\nPartnership brings new reach while equity stake offsets operating costs\r\nThe move effectively marks a pivot toward blockchain, tokenization and, in the near distance, proof of personhood (PoP).\r\n\r\nGareth N. Genner, Trust Stamp’s CEO, says that from the company’s perspective, “the transaction is immediately accretive in that we have been able to restructure and reallocate existing resources to service this new revenue stream without incurring additional expenses.”\r\n\r\nGenner says that in bringing together “Trust Stamp’s unique AI-powered identity authentication and tokenization technology, Qenta’s global asset tokenization capability, and the power of the QOS permissioned blockchain,” the arrangement sets up “a robust identity and asset ecosystem designed to resist threats, including quantum computing, ransomware, and deepfake technologies.”\r\n\r\n“QID is a perfect fit for our mission of accelerating secure financial and societal inclusion,” Genner says. “The partnership allows our AI-powered technology to be deployed in a wider range of large-scale use cases, including national identity programs, while providing Trust Stamp with potentially valuable equity participation and offsetting a significant proportion of our operating costs.”\r\n\r\nOnward, then, for Trust Stamp.",

      "contentSnippet": "The Consumer Electronics Show has got underway in Las Vegas, and the annual tech bonanza brings with it a plethora of announcements.\r\nBiometric locks\r\nBenjiLock, which has been featured on ABC’s Shark Tank, has unveiled its BenjiLock Outdoor Fingerprint Padlock.\r\n\r\nA stainless steel padlock, the keyless padlock makes use of fingerprint biometrics to unlock without needing an associated app or WiFi. It can also store up to 10 fingerprints with its multi-user capability. It retails for $79.99 via ZenSupply.\r\n\r\nAnother unveiling came from Lockly, which showed off its Duet Series of smart deadbolts. This includes the $499.99 Vision Prestige Duet Series, which offers an integrated video camera with 2K resolution and facial biometrics. It is set to launch in Q4 2025. Also introduced: The Lockly Styla Designer Handlebar Deadbolt, which features an embedded 2K HD video camera with color night vision and motion sensors, a 3D fingerprint biometrics sensor, a two-way intercom and Lockly’s PIN Genie. The Styla Designer Handlebar Deadbolt will be available in Q3 2025 for $699.99.\r\n\r\nTP-Link unwrapped its latest Tapo branded products at CES ‘25, which features some advanced biometric solutions.\r\n\r\nFor example, the new Tapo PalmKey uses palm vein biometrics recognition, allowing authorized users to unlock whether their hands are wet or dirty. Palm vein biometrics are known to be highly unique to each individual and can be more convenient than other biometrics — the Tap PalmKey allows users to wave their hand in front of the lock to open it, for instance, but also supports fingerprints as well as more traditional unlocking methods.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Philips Home Access Smart Door Locks was recognized as a CES Innovation Awards 2025 Honoree for its 5000 Series Palm Recognition Smart Lock, which adds video capabilities to its palm vein recognition.\r\nBest of Innovation awards\r\nSuprema has won Best of Innovation award, along with 18 other companies, at CES.\r\n\r\nSuprema won with its Q-Vision Pro on-device AI module, which is designed to prevent financial crime such as voice phishing.\r\n\r\nThe module can be installed in ATMs and uses AI-enabled face biometrics and behavior analysis to prevent illegitimate transactions. Leveraging multi-layer data encryption, the solution allows an ATM to support up to 50,000 users without needing a network connection.\r\n\r\nFellow Korean start-up Ghost Pass also won the award, receiving the Best of Innovation in FinTech for its decentralized on-device biometric authentication solution.\r\n\r\nGhost Pass allows users to store biometric information on their smartphone securely with third-party access to the biometric information technically impossible. The solution avoids cloud servers or other devices by storing the biometrics only on the user’s smartphone.\r\nSelfies and business executives\r\nThe use of AI is growing amongst fraudsters and scammers, with deepfakes posing a potentially high value problem to businesses.\r\n\r\nFrench start-up Inkan.link has created a solution to combat the rise of CEO impersonation and other high-level fakery, with its Sealfie product.\r\n\r\nBusiness Email Compromise (BEC) reportedly costs businesses $5 billion every year, but the Paris-based cybersecurity company is set to debut Sealfie at CES 2025 and attract sign-ups.\r\n\r\nSealfie works simply by asking a person for a selfie to prove identity and combat deepfakes. “If your CEO won’t take a selfie to approve a major transaction, they’re probably an imposter,” Inkan.link founder Nicholas Thomas said.\r\n\r\nCollaborating with ShareID, Inkan.link’s Sealfie is available on Android and iOS and requires a €95 per month subscription per user.",

      "contentSnippet": "While money is rapidly flowing into the coffers of criminals carrying out fraud around the world, capital is being invested in those defending against fraud, with ThreatMark announcing a major funding round to back its market expansion.\r\n\r\nThe global cost of fraud surpassed a trillion dollars in total losses, according to stats compiled by Feedzai and a partner, while regulators in the U.S. and UK have identified APP scams and social media as big parts of the problem.\r\n$23M for ThreatMark\r\nThreatMark has raised $23 million in funding to expand the market reach of its behavioral biometrics and other fraud prevention technologies in key regions. The company also plans to boost its research and development and upgrade the capabilities of its software.\r\n\r\nThe funding round was led by a $15 million contribution from Octopus Ventures and Riverside Acceleration Capital (RAC). The former is focused mainly on the UK and Europe, while the latter is based in the U.S., ThreatMark notes in the announcement.\r\n\r\nSpringtide Ventures contributed the other $8 million in the form of a convertible note.\r\n\r\nThreatMark also raised $13 million in 2023, including $5 million from Orbit Capital late in the year.\r\n\r\nThe company claims a 75 percent year-over-year increase in annual recurring revenue (ARR) in the past year, and says it has not raised a total of $37 million.\r\n\r\n“The team has had a stellar 12 months of growth, and with our support, we’re confident they can continue to build on this momentum through expanding into the UK and U.S. market,” says Octopus Ventures Partner Paul Davidson in the company announcement. “Online banking fraud is a huge and complex problem for the financial services sectors, one that requires an increasingly sophisticated approach to fraud detection. ThreatMark is set to play a progressively central role combating it.”\r\n\r\nAmong its advantages in the market, ThreatMark says it has demonstrated effectiveness at stopping complex digital fraud threats, including authorized push payment (APP) scams.\r\nAPP and social media scams common\r\nAPP scams have become one of the top priorities for the UK’s Payment System Regulator, according to its new report “Unmasking how fraudsters target UK consumers in the digital age.”\r\n\r\nThis type of fraud alone cost UK consumers 341 million pounds (US$426 million) in 2023, the report says.\r\n\r\nThe report describes the methods and costs of purchase, romance, impersonation and other kinds of scams. The most common vector of APP scam delivery is social media and messaging platforms, and social media platforms feature prominently in the report as common channels for fraud.\r\n\r\nBioCatch responded to the report with a blog post calling for more data sharing and cross-regulatory collaboration, along with the use of behavior and device intelligence.\r\n\r\nThe U.S. Federal Trade Commission counts $10 billion in total losses from fraud in the country during 2023, $4.6 billion of which was from investment scams.\r\n\r\nThe figure is a 14 percent increase from 2022, as digital tools make fraud attacks easier. Impersonation was the most common type of fraud reported in 2023.\r\n\r\nLike the UK Regulator, the FTC fingers social media as the most fraud-riddled channel of communication.\r\nScam losses reach $1T\r\nA new report from Feedzai and the Global Anti-Scam Alliance (GASA) pegs the amount of money stolen by fraudsters over the past year at more than $1 trillion.\r\n\r\nA mere 4 percent of scam victims are able to fully recover their stolen money, according to the 2024 Global State of Scams Report.\r\n\r\nThe report is drawn from a survey with more than 58,000 respondents, and shows that consumers are facing frequent fraud attempts, with half exposed to at lest one scam per week. Victims in the U.S., one of the hardest-hit countries along with Denmark and Switzerland, lost over $3,500 on average, while losses in Pakistan, Kenya and South Africa range from 3.4 percent to 4.2 percent of national GDP, illustrating the impact of fraud volumes on developing economies.\r\n\r\nWhile fraud operates across borders, the report emphasizes the need for fraud prevention strategies to be tailored to the challenges of the specific region in which they are deployed.\r\n\r\nFeedzai’s RiskOps platform, meanwhile, has been awarded as the “Best Use of AI for Fraud and Financial Crime Prevention” at the 7th Regulation Asia Awards for Excellence 2024.",

      "contentSnippet": "A two-hour conversation with an AI model is enough to create a fairly accurate image of a real person’s personality, according to researchers from Google and Stanford University.\n\n\n\nAs part of a recent study, the researchers were able to generate “simulation agents” — essentially AI replicas — of 1,052 people based on two-hour interviews with each participant. These interviews, based on an interview protocol developed by the American Voices Project, which explores a range of topics of interest to social scientists, including life stories and views on current societal issues, were used to train a generative AI model designed to mimic human behavior. \n\n\n\nTo then evaluate the accuracy of the AI ​​replicas, each participant completed two rounds of personality tests, social surveys, and logic games. When the AI ​​replicas completed the same tests, their results matched the answers of their human counterparts with 85% accuracy. \n\n\n\nWhen answering personality questionnaires, the AI ​​clones’ responses differed little from their human counterparts. They performed particularly well when it came to reproducing answers to personality questionnaires and determining social attitudes. But they were less accurate when it came to predicting behavior in interactive games that involved economic decisions.  \n\n\n\nA question of purpose\n\n\n\nThe impetus for the development of the simulation agents was the possibility of using them to conduct studies that would be expensive, impractical, or unethical with real human subjects, the scientists explain. For example, the AI ​​models could help to evaluate the effectiveness of public health measures or better understand reactions to product launches. Even modeling reactions to important social events would be conceivable, according to the researchers.  \n\n\n\n“General-purpose simulation of human attitudes and behavior—where each simulated person can engage across a range of social, political, or informational contexts—could enable a laboratory for researchers to test a broad set of interventions and theories,” the researchers write.\n\n\n\nHowever, the scientists also acknowledge that the technology could be misused. For example, the simulation agents could be used to deceive other people online with deepfake attacks. \n\n\n\nSecurity experts already see deepfake technology rapidly advancing and believe it’s a matter of time before cybercriminals find a business model they can use against companies.\n\n\n\nMany executives have already said their companies have been targeted with deepfake scams of late, in particular around targeting financial data. Security company Exabeam recently discussed an incident in which a deepfake was used as part of a job interview in conjunction with the rising North Korean fake IT worker scam.\n\n\n\nThe Google and Stanford researchers propose the creation of an “agent bank” of the 1,000-plus simulation agents they have generated. The bank, hosted at Stanford University, would “provide controlled research-only API access to agent behaviors,” according to the researchers.\n\n\n\nWhile the research does not expressly advance any capabilities for the creation of deepfakes, it does show what is fast becoming possible in terms of creating simulated human personalities in advanced research today.",

      "title": "Ambitious Projects Could Reshape Geopolitics",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/geopolitics-and-technology",
      "contentSnippet": "Over the last year, Spectrum’s editors have noticed an emerging through line connecting several major stories: the centrality of technology to geopolitics. Last month, our cover story, done in partnership with Foreign Policy magazine, was on the future of submarine warfare. And last October, we focused on how sea drones could bolster Taiwan’s “silicon shield” strategy, which rests on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s domination of high-end chip manufacturing. So when I asked the curator of this issue, Senior Editor Samuel K. Moore, what he saw as the major theme as we head into 2025, I wasn’t surprised when he said, without hesitation, “geopolitics and technology.” In fact, the same day Sam and I spoke, I forwarded to Spectrum’s Glenn Zorpette a news item about China banning the export to the United States of gallium, germanium and antimony. China’s overwhelming command of rare earths like these is at the heart of Zorpette’s story in this issue. “Inside an American Rare Earth Boomtown” paints a vivid picture of how the United States is trying to nurture a domestic rare earth mining and processing industry. China, meanwhile, is itself looking to minimize its own dependence on imported uranium by building a thorium-based molten-salt reactor in the Gobi Desert. And tensions between China and Taiwan will undoubtedly be further stressed with the opening of TSMC’s first advanced wafer fab in the United States this year.The mitigation of climate change is another key area where politics informs tech advances. In “Startups Begin Geoengineering the Sea”, Senior Associate Editor Emily Waltz takes readers aboard a pair of barges anchored near the Port of Los Angeles. There, two companies, Captura and Equatic, are piloting marine carbon-capture systems to strip CO2 out of ocean water. Whether the results can be measured accurately enough to help companies and countries meet their carbon-reduction goals is an open question.One way for the international community to study the impacts of these efforts could be Deep’s Sentinel program, the first part of which will be completed this year. Our correspondent Liam Critchley, based in England, reports in “Making Humans Aquatic Again” that Deep, located in Bristol, is building a modular habitat that will let scientists live underwater for weeks at a time.Another geopolitical concern also lies at sea: the vulnerability of undersea fiber-optic cables, which carry an ever-growing share of the world’s Internet traffic. The possibility of outages due to attack or accident is so worrying that NATO is funding a project to quickly detect undersea-cable damage and reroute data to satellites. In a provocative commentary on why technology will define the future of geopolitics published in Foreign Affairs in 2023, Eric Schmidt, chair of the Special Competitive Studies Project and the former CEO and chair of Google, argues that “a country’s ability to project power in the international sphere—militarily, economically, and culturally—depends on its ability to innovate faster and better than its competitors.” In this issue, you’ll get an idea of how various nations are faring in this regard. In the coming year, you can look forward to our continuing analysis of how the new U.S. administration’s policies on basic research, climate change, regulation, and immigration impact global competition for the raw materials and human resources that stoke the engines of innovation.",

      "title": "As EV Sales Stall, Plug-In Hybrids Get a Reboot",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/plug-in-hybrid",
      "contentSnippet": "Automakers got one thing right: Electrified cars are the future. What they got wrong was assuming that all of those vehicles would run on battery power alone, with gasoline-electric hybrid technology bound for the technological scrap heap.\n\n\t Now the automaking giants are scrambling to course correct. They’re delaying their EV plans, rejiggering factories, and acknowledging what some clear-eyed observers (including \n\tIEEE Spectrum) suspected all along: Not every car buyer is ready or able to ditch the internal-combustion engine entirely, stymied by high EV prices or unnerved by a patchy, often-unreliable charging infrastructure.\n\n\n\t\tThis article is part of our special report \n\t\tTop Tech 2025.\n\t\n\n\tConsumers are still looking for electrified rides, just not the ones that many industry pundits predicted. In \n\tChina, Europe, and the United States, buyers are converging on hybrids, whose sales growth is outpacing that of pure EVs. “It’s almost been a religion that it’s EVs or bust, so let’s not fool around with hybrids or hydrogen,” says Michael Dunne, CEO of Dunne Insights, a leading analyst of China’s auto industry. “But even in the world’s largest market, almost half of electrified vehicle sales are hybrids.”\n\n\t In China, which accounts for about two-thirds of global \n\telectrified sales, buyers are flocking to plug-in hybrids, or PHEVs, which combine a gas engine with a rechargeable battery pack. Together, hybrids and all-electric vehicles (a category that the Chinese government calls “new energy vehicles”) reached a milestone last July, outselling internal-combustion engine cars in that country for the first time. PHEV sales are up 85 percent year-over-year, dwarfing the 12-percent gain for pure EVs.\n\n\t The picture is different in the United States, where customers still favor conventional hybrids that combine a gas engine with a small battery—no plug involved, no driver action required. Through September 2024, this year’s conventional hybrid sales in the United States have soared past 1.1 million, accounting for 10.6 percent of the overall car market, versus an 8.9 percent share for pure EVs, according to \n\tWards Intelligence. Including PHEVs, that means a record 21 percent of the country’s new cars are now electrified.\n\n\tBut even as overall EV sales rise, plug-in hybrid sales have stalled at a mere 2 percent of the U.S. market. A J.D. Power \n\tsurvey also showed low levels of satisfaction among PHEV owners.\n\n\t Those numbers are a disappointment to automakers and regulators, who have looked to PHEVs as a bridge technology between gasoline vehicles and pure EVs. But what if the problem isn’t plug-in tech per se but the type of PHEVs being offered? Could another market pivot be just around the corner?\nPlug-in Hybrids: The Next Generation\n\tThe Ram brand, a part of \n\tStellantis, is betting on new plug-in technology with its Ram 1500 Ramcharger, a brash full-size pickup scheduled to go on sale later this year.\n\n\tThe Ramcharger is what’s known as an extended-range electric vehicle, or EREV. An EREV resembles a PHEV, pairing gas and electric powertrains, but with two key differences: An EREV integrates much larger batteries, enough to rack up significant all-electric miles before the internal-combustion engine kicks in; and the gas engine in an EREV is used entirely to generate electricity, not to propel the car directly.\n\nBMW demonstrated EREV tech beginning in 2013 with its pint-size i3 REx, which used a tiny motorcycle engine to generate electricity. The Chevrolet Volt, produced from 2010 to 2019, also used its gasoline engine largely as a generator, although it could partially propel the car in certain conditions. The short-lived 2012 Fisker Karma took a similar approach. None of these vehicles made much impact on the market. As a large pickup with conventional styling, the Ramcharger appears to be a more mainstream proposition.\n\n\nThe platform for the 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger includes a V6 engine, a 92-kilowatt-hour battery pack, and a 130-kilowatt generator. Stellantis\n\n\tThe Ramcharger shares its STLA Frame platform and electrical architecture with the upcoming pure-battery \n\tRam 1500 REV, but it’s designed to provide more driving range, along with the option of gasoline fill-ups when there are no EV chargers around. Although the Ramcharger’s 92-kilowatt-hour battery has less than half the capacity of the Ram REV’s humongous upgraded 229-kWh battery (the largest ever in a passenger EV), it’s hardly small. The Ramcharger still packs more battery power than many all-electric vehicles, such as the Ford Mustang Mach-E and the Tesla Model 3.\n\n\tOriginally, Ram planned to launch its EV pickup first. But based on consumer response, the brand decided to prioritize the Ramcharger; the Ram 1500 REV will now follow in 2026.\n\n\t Ram estimates that its pickup will travel about 233 kilometers (145 miles) on a fully charged battery, more than three times the stated 71-km electric range of a compact \n\tToyota Prius Prime, among the U.S. market’s longest-range PHEVs. For typical commuters and around-town drivers, “that’s enough range where you could really use this truck as an EV 95 percent of the time,” says Ed Kim, chief analyst of AutoPacific.\n\n\tWhen the battery runs down below a preset level, the gasoline engine kicks in and generates 130 kilowatts of electricity to the battery, which continues to feed the permanent-magnet motors that propel the car. Since the motors do all the work, an EREV mimics an EV, needing no conventional transmission or driveshaft. But the onboard generator enables the Ramcharger to drive much farther than any conventional EV can.\nExtended-Range EVs: The Long Haul\n\tWith batteries and gasoline working in tandem, the Ramcharger has an extended range of 1,110 km (690 miles), dwarfing the 824-km range of the \n\tLucid Air Grand Touring, the current EV long-distance champ. And unlike many PHEVs, whose performance suffers when they rely on battery juice alone, the Ramcharger doesn’t skimp on power. The system churns up a mighty 494 kW (663 horsepower) and 834 newton-meters of torque. Ram estimates the Ramcharger will go from 0 to 60 miles per hour (0 to 97 kilometers per hour) in 4.4 seconds.\n\n\tUsing the engine solely as a generator also addresses a couple of key criticisms of PHEVs: skimpy all-electric range, especially if the owner rarely bothers to plug it in, and compromised efficiency when the car runs primarily on gasoline.\n\n\t “Today’s PHEVs can be extremely efficient or extremely inefficient, all depending on how a customer decides to use it,” Kim says. “If they never plug in, it ends up being a hybrid that’s heavier than it needs to be, hauling around a battery it doesn’t really use.”\n\n\tIn an EREV, by contrast, the engine can operate constantly in its most frugal operating range, which maximizes its thermal efficiency, rather than constantly revving from idle to high speeds and wasting fuel.\n\n\t The Ramcharger should also excel at actual hauling. Some truck loyalists have soured on all-electric pickups like the \n\tFord F-150 Lightning, whose maximum 515-km range can drop by 50 percent or more when it’s towing or hauling heavy loads. The Ramcharger is rated to tow up to 14,000 pounds (6,350 kilograms) and to handle up to 2,625 pounds (1,190 kg) in its cargo bed. Company officials insist that its range won’t be unduly dinged by heavy lifting, although they haven’t yet revealed details.\nChina Embraces EREVs\n\tIf China is the bellwether for all things electric, the EREV could be the next big thing. EREVs now make up nearly a third of the nation’s plug-in-hybrid sales, according to \n\tBloomberg New Energy Finance. Beijing-based Li Auto, founded nine years ago by billionaire entrepreneur Xiang Li, makes EREVs exclusively; its sales jumped nearly 50 percent in 2024. Big players, including Geely Auto and SAIC Motor Corp., are also getting into the game.\n\n\nLi Auto’s Li L9, shown here at a 2024 auto show in Tianjin, China, is an extended-range hybrid SUV designed for China’s wide-open spaces.NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\n\tThe \n\tLi L9 is a formidable example of China’s EREV tech. The crossover SUV pairs a 44.5-kWh nickel cobalt manganese battery with a 1.5-liter turbo engine, for a muscular 330 kW (443 horsepower). Despite having a much smaller battery than the Ramcharger, the all-wheel-drive L9 can cover 180 km on a single charge. Then its four-cylinder engine, operating at a claimed 40.5 percent thermal efficiency, extends the total range to 1,100 km, perfect for China’s wide-open spaces.\n\n\t Dunne notes that in terms of geography and market preferences, China is more similar to the United States than it is to Europe. All-electric EVs predominate in China’s wealthier cities and coastal areas, but in outlying regions—characterized by long-distance drives and scarce public charging—many Chinese buyers are spurning EVs in favor of hybrids, much like their U.S. counterparts.\n\n\t Those parallels may bode well for EREV tech in the United States and elsewhere. When the Ramcharger was first announced in November 2023, it looked like an outlier. Since then, Nissan, Hyundai, Mazda, and General Motors’ Buick brand have all announced EREV plans of their own.\n\n\nVolkswagen’s Scout Traveler SUV, due out in 2027, is another entry in the extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) category.Scout Motors\n\n\tIn October, Volkswagen unveiled a revival of the Scout, the charming off-roaders built by International Harvester between 1960 and 1980. The announcement came with a surprise twist: Both the Scout Traveler SUV and Scout Terra pickup will offer EREV models. (In a nod to the brand’s history, Scout’s EREV system is called “Harvester.”) The hybrid versions will have an estimated 500-mile (800-km) range, easily beating the 350-mile (560-km) range of their all-electric siblings. According to a crowdsourced tracker, about \n\tfour-fifths of people reserving a Scout are opting for an EREV model.\nToyota Gets the Last Laugh\n\tFor \n\tToyota, the market swing toward hybrid vehicles comes as a major vindication. The world’s largest automaker had faced withering attacks for being slow to add all-electric vehicles to its lineup, focusing more on hybrids as a transitional technology. In 2021, Toyota’s decision to redesign its Sienna minivan exclusively as a hybrid seemed risky. Its decision to do the same with the 2025 Camry, America’s best-selling sedan, seemed riskier still. Now Toyota and its luxury brand, Lexus, control nearly 60 percent of the hybrid market in North America.\n\n\nToyota was criticized for sticking with hybrid cars like the Prius, but it now controls nearly 60 percent of the North American hybrid market. Toyota\n\n\tAlthough Toyota hasn’t yet announced any plans for an EREV, the latest Toyota Prius shows the fruits of five generations and nearly 30 years of hybrid R&D. A 2024 Prius starts at around $29,000, with up to 196 horsepower (146 kW) from its 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle engine and tiny lithium-ion battery—enough to go 0-97 km/h in a little over 7 seconds. The larger 2025 Camry hybrid is rated at up to 48 miles per gallon (20 kilometers per liter).\n\n\t Market analysts expect the \n\tToyota RAV4, the most-popular SUV in the United States, to go hybrid-only around 2026. David Christ, Toyota’s North American general manager, indicated that “the company is not opposed” to eventually converting all of its internal-combustion models to hybrids.\n\n\tMeanwhile, GM, Ford, Honda, and other brands are rapidly introducing \n\tmore hybrids as well. Stellantis is offering plug-in models from Jeep, Chrysler, and Dodge in addition to the EREV Ramcharger. Even the world’s most rarefied sports-car brands are adopting hybrid technology because of its potential to improve performance significantly—and to do so without reducing fuel economy. [For more on high-performance hybrids, see \"A Hybrid Car That's Also a Supercar\".]\n\nThe electricity-or-nothing crowd may regard hybrids as a compromise technology that continues to prop up demand for fossil fuels. But by meeting EV-skeptical customers halfway, models that run on both batteries and gasoline could ultimately convert more people to electrification, hasten the extinction of internal-combustion dinosaurs, and make a meaningful dent in \n\tcarbon emissions.",

      "contentSnippet": "Aside from having four wheels, it’s hard to see what a US $30,000 Toyota Camry has in common with a $3 million Ferrari F80. But these market bookends are examples of an under-the-radar tech revolution. From budget transportation to hypercars, every category of internal-combustion car is now harnessing hybrid tech. In “As EV Sales Stall, Plug-In Hybrids Get a Reboot,” I describe the vanguard of this new hybrid boom: extended-range EVs like the 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger, which boasts a range of more than 1,000 kilometers. The world’s leading performance brands are also embracing hybrid EV tech—not merely to cut emissions or boost efficiency but because of the instant-on, highly controllable torque produced by electric motors. Hybridized models from BMW, Corvette, Ferrari, and Porsche are aimed at driving enthusiasts who have been notoriously resistant to electric cars. Sam Fiorani, vice-president of global vehicle forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions, predicts that “nearly all light-duty internal-combustion engines are likely to be hybridized in one form or another over the next decade.” Even mainstream electrified models, Fiorani notes, routinely generate acceleration times that were once limited to exotic machines. “The performance offered by electric motors cannot be accomplished by gas-powered engines alone without impacting emissions,” Fiorani says. “The high-end brands will need to make the leap that only an electric powertrain can practically provide.” That leap is well underway, as I experienced firsthand during test drives of the BMW M5, Corvette E-Ray, and Ferrari 296 GTB. These performance hybrids outperform their internal-combustion-only equivalents in almost every way. Most incorporate all-wheel-drive, along with torque vectoring, energy harvesting, and other engineering tricks that are possible with the inclusion of electric motors.2025 BMW M5: The Heavyweight Hybrid\n\nThe BMW M5 sedan is a literal heavyweight, tipping the scales at 2,435 kilograms.BMW The 2025 BMW M5 sedan adds plug-in hybrid power to one of the company’s iconic models. A twin-turbo, 4.4-liter V-8 engine pairs with a fifth-generation BMW eMotor and a 14.8-kilowatt-hour battery. The M5 can cruise silently on battery power for 69 km (43 miles). The biggest downside is the car’s crushing curb weight—up to 2,500 kilograms (5,500 pounds)—and poor fuel economy once its electric range is spent. The upside is 527 kilowatts (717 horsepower) of Teutonic aggression, which I experienced from Munich to the Black Forest, making Autobahn sprints at up to 280 kph (174 mph). Ferrari 296 GTB and F80: Top of the Hybrid Food Chain\n\nAlthough the Ferrari 296 GTB is a plug-in hybrid, its goal is high performance, not high gas mileage.Ferrari Ferrari’s swoopy 296 GTB is a plug-in hybrid with a 122-kW electric motor sandwiched between a 3.0-liter V-6 and an F1 automated gearbox, producing a total of 602 kilowatts (819 horsepower). The 296 GTB can cover just 25 km on electricity alone, but that could be enough to pass through European low-emission zones, where internal-combustion cars may eventually be banned. Of course, the 296 GTB’s main goal is high performance, not high gas mileage. A digital brake-by-wire system makes it Ferrari’s shortest-stopping production car, and the brakes regenerate enough energy that I was able to recharge the 7.5-kWh battery on-the-fly in roughly 10 minutes of driving. Despite its modest V-6 engine, the 296 GTB turns faster laps around Ferrari’s Fiorano test circuit than any V-8 model in company history. The Ferrari weighs in at 1,467 kilograms (3,234 pounds), unusually svelte for a hybrid, which aids its sharp handling. At the top of the hybrid food chain is Ferrari’s F80, a hypercar inspired by Formula 1 racers. It pairs a V-6 with five electric motors—two in turbochargers, three for propulsion—for a total of 882 kW (1,200 horsepower). The two electric motors driving the front wheels allow for independent torque vectoring. Only 799 of the F80s will be built, but those numbers do not capture the cultural impact of harnessing hybrid tech in one of the world’s most exclusive sports cars. Porsche 911 GTS T-Hybrid: A First for Porsche The Porsche 911 now has its first electrified design. The new Porsche 911 GTS T-Hybrid keeps the model’s classic flat-six, rear-engine layout but adds a 40-kW electric motor, for a combined 391 kW (532 horsepower). Another 20-kW motor drives a single electric turbocharger, which has much less lag and wasted heat than mechanical turbochargers do. \n\nPorsche’s 911 GTS T-Hybrid is the carmaker’s first electric car offering.PorscheThe 911 GTS T-Hybrid’s 400-volt system quickly spools that turbo up to 120,000 rpm; peak turbo boost arrives in less than one second, versus more than three seconds before [[",

      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/switchbot-k20-pro-ces",
      "contentSnippet": "Earlier this year, we reviewed the SwitchBot S10, a vacuuming and wet mopping robot that uses a water-integrated docking system to autonomously manage both clean and dirty water for you. It’s a pretty clever solution, and we appreciated that SwitchBot was willing to try something a little different. At CES this week, SwitchBot introduced the K20+ Pro, a little autonomous vacuum that can integrate with a bunch of different accessories by pulling them around on a backpack cart of sorts. The K20+ Pro is SwitchBot’s latest effort to explore what’s possible with mobile home robots.\n\nSwitchBot’s small vacuum can transport different payloads on top.SwitchBotWhat we’re looking at here is a “mini” robotic vacuum (it’s about 25 centimeters in diameter) that does everything a robotic vacuum does nowadays: It uses lidar to make a map of your house so that you can direct it where to go, it’s got a dock to empty itself and recharge, and so on. The mini robotic vacuum is attached to a wheeled platform that SwitchBot is calling a “FusionPlatform” that sits on top of the robot like a hat. The vacuum docks to this platform, and then the platform will go wherever the robot goes. This entire system (robot, dock, and platform) is the “K20+ Pro multitasking household robot.”SwitchBot refers to the K20+ Pro as a “smart delivery assistant,” because you can put stuff on the FusionPlatform and the K20+ Pro will move that stuff around your house for you. This really doesn’t do it justice, though, because the platform is much more than just a passive mobile cart. It also can provide power to a bunch of different accessories, all of which benefit from autonomous mobility:\n\nThe SwitchBot can carry a variety of payloads, including custom payloads.SwitchBotFrom left to right, you’re looking at an air circulation fan, a tablet stand, a vacuum and charging dock and an air purifier and security camera (and a stick vacuum for some reason), and lastly just the air purifier and security setup. You can also add and remove different bits, like if you want the fan along with the security camera, just plop the security camera down on the platform base in front of the fan and you’re good to go.This basic concept is somewhat similar to Amazon’s Proteus robot, in the sense that you can have one smart powered base that moves around a bunch of less smart and unpowered payloads by driving underneath them and then carrying them around. But SwitchBot’s payloads aren’t just passive cargo, and the base can provide them with a useful amount of power.\n\nA power port allows you to develop your own payloads for the robot.SwitchBotSwitchBot is actively encouraging users to “to create, adapt, and personalize the robot for a wide variety of innovative applications,” which may include “3D-printed components [or] third-party devices with multiple power ports for speakers, car fridges, or even UV sterilization lamps,” according to the press release. The maximum payload is only 8 kilograms, though, so don’t get too crazy.\n\nSeveral SwitchBots can make bath time much more enjoyable.SwitchBotWhat we all want to know is when someone will put an arm on this thing, and SwitchBot is of course already working on this:\n\nSwitchBot’s mobile manipulator is still in the lab stage.SwitchBotThe arm is still “in the lab stage,” SwichBot says, which I’m guessing means that the hardware is functional but that getting it to reliably do useful stuff with the arm is still a work in progress. But that’s okay—getting an arm to reliably do useful stuff is a work in progress for all of robotics, pretty much. And if SwitchBot can manage to produce an affordable mobile manipulation platform for consumers that even sort of works, that’ll be very impressive.",

      "title": "CES 2025 Preview: Needleless Injections, E-Skis, and More",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/ces-2025",
      "contentSnippet": "This weekend, I’m on my way to Las Vegas to cover this year’s Consumer Electronics Show. I’ve scoured the CES schedule and lists of exhibitors in preparation for the event, where I hope to find fascinating new tech. After all, some prep is required given the size of the show: CES span 12 venues and more than 2.5 million square feet of exhibit space—a good opportunity to test out devices that will be on display, like these shoe attachments that track muscle load for athletes (and journalists running between demos), or an exoskeleton to help out on hikes through the Mojave Desert. Of course, AI will continue to show up in every device you might imagine it to, and many you wouldn’t. This year, there will be AI-enabled vehicle sensors and PCs, as well as spice dispensers, litter boxes, and trash cans. With AI systems for baby care and better aging, the applications practically range from cradle to grave. I’m also looking forward to discovering technology that could change the way we interact with our devices, such as new displays in our personal vehicles and smart eyewear to compete with Ray-Ban Meta glasses.Hidden among the big names showcasing their latest tech, startups and smaller companies will be exhibiting products that could become the next big thing, and the innovative engineering behind them. Here are a few of the gadgets and gizmos I’m planning to see in person this week. Needle-Free InjectionsImagine a world in which you could get a flu shot—or any injection—without getting jabbed by a needle. That’s what Dutch company FlowBeams aims to create with its device, which injects a thin jet of liquid directly into the skin. With a radius of 25 micrometers, the jet measures about one-tenth the size of a 25-gauge needle often used for vaccines. Personally, I’ve dealt with my fair share of needles from living with type 1 diabetes for nearly two decades, so this definitely caught my eye. Delivering insulin is, in fact, one of the medical applications the FlowBeams team imagines the tech could eventually be used for. But healthcare isn’t the only potential use. It could also become a new, supposedly painless way to get cosmetic fillers or a tattoo. Electric Skis to Help With HillsSkiing may initially seem like the recreational activity least in need of a motorized boost—gravity is pretty reliable on its own. But if you, like me, actually prefer cross country skiing, it’s an intriguing idea. Now being brought to life by a Swiss startup, E-Skimo was created for ski mountaineering (A.K.A. “skimo”), a type of backcountry skiing that involves climbing up a mountain to then speed back down. The battery-powered, detachable device uses a belt of rubber tread to help skiers get to higher peaks in less time. Unfortunately, Vegas will be a bit too balmy for live demos. A Fitbit for Fido—and for BessieNearly any accessory you own today—watches, rings, jewelry, or glasses—can be replaced by a wearable tech alternative. But what about your dog? Now, we can extend our obsession with health metrics to our pets with the next generation of smart collars from companies like Queva, which is debuting a collar that grades your dog’s health on a 100-point scale. While activity-tracking collars have been on the market for several years, these and other devices, like smart pet flaps, are making our pets more high-tech than ever.And the same is true for livestock: The first wearable device for tracking a cow’s vitals will also be at CES this year. While not exactly a consumer device, it’s a fascinating find nonetheless. Real-Time TranslationDouglas Adams fans, rejoice: Inspired by the Babel fish from The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy, Timekettle’s earbuds make (nearly) real-time translation possible. The company’s latest version operates with a new, proprietary operating system to offer two-way translation during phone or video calls on any platform. The US $449 open-ear buds translate between more than 40 languages and 93 accents, albeit with a 3 to 5 second delay. “Hormometer” to Subdue StressIronically, everybody seems stressed out about cortisol, the hormone that regulates your body’s stress response. To make hormone testing more accessible, Eli Health has created a device, dubbed the “Hormometer,” which detects either cortisol or progesterone levels from a quick saliva sample. After 20 minutes, the user scans the tester with a smartphone camera and gets results. At about $8 per test, each one is much less expensive than other at-home or lab tests. However, the company functions as a subscription service, starting at about $65 per month with a 12-month commitment. AR Binoculars to Seamlessly ID the Natural WorldI have a confession to make: For someone who once considered a career in astronomy, I can identify embarrassingly few constellations. Alas, after Orion and the Big Dipper, I have trouble finding many of these patterns in the night sky. Stargazing apps help, but looking back and forth between a screen and the sky tends to ruin the moment. Unistellar’s Envision smart binoculars, however, use augmented reality to map the stars, tag comets, and label nebulae directly in your line of sight. During the day, they can identify hiking trails or tell you the altitude of a summit on the horizon. When it comes to identifying the best technology on the horizon, though, leave that job to IEEE Spectrum.",

But how do you make sure you don't drop those aspirations by February? Alex has some tips and tricks to get you focused for the year ahead - and ensure your dreams become reality. \n\nTips &amp; Tricks to Help You on Your 2025 Journey: \n\nBuild a system versus just setting goals. This will help you achieve your goals by creating a more sustainable system that fits with your lifestyle. For example, if you want to improve your coding skills, make a habit to set aside some time each day to work on it. Keep your habits low impact and realistic. As a plus, this will save you a LOT of stress.\nProcrastination is your biggest pitfall. We all fall into this trap but try your best to avoid it. Use lists, timeblocking, and have alternate projects you can lean on when you need to deviate from your scheduled tasks. You can also hit up the two-minute trick: If something just takes you only a few minutes to do, then do it. \nStart early! There is no better time than the present to start something new. If you don't feel up to something, tomorrow will likely be no different for you. Therefore, avoid putting things off as much as you can. \nSkip one day, but never more than that. Give yourself some grace, and if you need to let a day slide, that's okay. However, if you find yourself adding another day to your grace period, it's probable that you will only continue to add more days. This trick will help you save yourself from the &quot;habit graveyard&quot; (as Alex puts it).\n\nWhat tricks help you stay on track with your goals? Other members of the TCMS community would love to see what works for you! We will be sharing more goalsetting resources and career maps, so keep following us for some support on your 2025 journey! \n\n#goalsetting #goalsettingjourney #cybersecurity #goalsetting2025 #professionaldevelopment \n\n📱Social Media📱\n___________________________________________\nX: https://x.com/TCMSecurity\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/thecybermentor\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tcmsecurity/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/tcm-security-inc/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@tcmsecurity\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/tcm\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/tcmsecure\n\n💸Donate💸\n___________________________________________\nLike the channel?

      "link": "https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/the-secs-8-k-cybersecurity-incident-disclosures-for-2024-timeline",
      "contentSnippet": "It’s been more than a year since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new rules to enhance the annual reporting of cybersecurity measures practiced by SEC registrants. These requirements are in addition to those about the timely disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents that these companies experience. This tougher stance from the SEC has prompted executives and boards of directors to look at cybersecurity, not as an afterthought, but as a business-critical priority. The SEC’s new rules also hold these leaders and their companies legally accountable should they not follow the agency's cybersecurity rules — putting chief information security officers in the hot seat. In the first year of the program, more than 20 cybersecurity incidents were disclosed to the commission via corporations' filings of Form 8-K. Listed below in chronological order are those 22 filings, including details such as the filing date, the target of the incident, and the impact that the incident had on the business.While the SEC’s cybersecurity-incident disclosure rules are generally positive for the betterment of cybersecurity, readers who follow the links for each filing will see that the vast majority of these disclosures don’t yield much information beyond what we describe below. Details missing from the forms include the type of attack, the identity of the attack’s perpetrators, and how the perpetrators were able to breach the company’s systems in the first place. This is because the SEC’s rules for Form 8-K only ask registrants to disclose “The material aspects of the nature, scope, and timing of the incident; and the material impact or reasonably likely material impact on the registrant, including on the registrant’s financial condition and results of operations.” The commission also clearly stated in its announcement of the new rules last year that it doesn’t require registrants “to disclose specific or technical information about its planned response to the incident or its cybersecurity systems, related networks and devices, or potential system vulnerabilities in such detail that would impede its response or remediation of the incident.”What this means is that these 8-K disclosure rules do not provide the attack transparency that the cybersecurity community could use to bolster critical systems against similar incidents, bestowing instead only higher-level benefits to key market players, who will become more aware of registrants’ cybersecurity practices, and to registrants, who hopefully will take their cybersecurity efforts more seriously. Of course, some of the 8-K filings concern attacks previously reported in the media, and so we know something about the type of attack in those cases. Here are some of the trends that can be gleaned from that information.",

      "contentSnippet": "Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee has confirmed that cybercriminals are attempting to leak stolen data after gaining unauthorized access to the state's central platform for operating numerous health and human services divisions, including social benefits. \nWHY IT MATTERS\nMcKee’s office said Monday that, according to its consultant Deloitte, the hackers who broke into the IT system for the state's health and benefits programs earlier this month have released a set of files on the dark web, WPRI reported.\n\"Today the cyber criminals did in fact publish at least some of the Rhode Island Bridge's information and data files onto the dark web,\" McKee said during a press conference.\nIn a previous update on its website, the state said that Deloitte confirmed \"a high probability that a cybercriminal has obtained files with personally identifiable information.\"\nThe consultant is working with the state to generate the list of impacted individuals. \n\"Once we have that information, we will send letters to those individuals with instructions on how to access free credit monitoring,\" the alert said.\nHealthSource RI, the state’s marketplace for affordable health coverage, is part of the Ocean State's Department of Administration RIBridges system and is temporarily unavailable due to the cyberattack announced on December 13. \nAccording to the state website, the system that Deloitte manages is the main operations system for the state's management, including legal services, accounts and control, management and budget, purchasing, auditing, human resources, certain personnel services, capital asset management and maintenance, IT, energy resources and many internal services.\nThe state took the system offline after Deloitte discovered the network intrusion. \nRIBridges also manages the state's Medicaid, SNAP and other social programs, many of which have switched to manual processes. \nDue to the outage, HealthSource RI has extended open enrollment from Tuesday's deadline until February 28 via call center. Patients with plans that would not automatically renew for 2025 will now be extended until the system is restored and they can select new plans, according to the website alert.\nGovernment officials said they have identified about 650,000 people whose personal information – including Social Security and bank account numbers – was stolen from the system.\nDatabreaches.net reported Monday that it had made contact with Brain Cipher, and the ransomware group confirmed that they were responsible for the RIBridges attack and inspected the archive file with personal information provided by the threat actors. \nReaching the threat actors’ dark web leak site is challenging, however, according to the story. \nBrain Cipher told the publication that they have been under a denial of service attack to try and stop them from leaking the data. \nTHE LARGER TREND\nState records systems that hold protected health information are targeted in cyberattacks and criminals have been known to publish protected data.\nIn July, RansomHub began leaking Florida Department of Health employee records, prescription data, screening information, Social Security numbers and more on a Tor-based leak site. The group claimed to have stolen 100 gigabytes of data from the Sunshine State's public health network.\nHealthcare cybersecurity challenges outpace every other sector, according to an analysis of 2023 cyberattacks by SecurityScorecard, a supply chain cybersecurity firm. \nThe sector also leads in third-party data breaches, which snare providers, health plans, healthcare organizations and public health networks. Two years ago, a ransomware attack on a federal vendor, Healthcare Management Solutions, had the potential to impact up to 254,000 Medicare beneficiaries.\nWhile the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said that the vendor acted in \"violation of its obligations,\" the federal agency is also under investigation by the U.S. Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights for a cyber breach that ultimately affected 3,112,815 individuals, reported in September.\nThe recent CMS data breach was one in a string related to a vulnerability in the file transfer tool MOVEit.\nON THE RECORD\n\"Our top priority is exactly what we talked about – informing people, getting the information out, having people protect their identity and also get those benefits out,\" McKee said in response to a question about the state's continued relationship with Deloitte at Monday's televised press conference. \"The issues that have to do with IT, we will take those issues one day at a time.\"\nAndrea Fox is senior editor of Healthcare IT News.\nEmail: afox@himss.org\nHealthcare IT News is a HIMSS Media publication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Enterprise Taxonomy: Health Information ExchangeCybersecurity and PrivacySecurityData and Information",

      "contentSnippet": "Ransomware attacks are having a severe impact on U.S. healthcare organizations, with an alarming escalation in incidents and their consequences, according to a Comparitech report.\nThe study found that since 2018, 654 ransomware attacks have targeted healthcare providers, with 2023 standing out as a record-breaking year, logging 143 incidents.\nThese attacks compromised over 88.7 million patient records during this period, with more than 26.2 million breached in 2023 alone.\nEach day of downtime due to ransomware costs healthcare organizations an average of $1.9 million, culminating in an estimated $21.9 billion in downtime losses over six years.\nOn average, medical organizations experienced 17 days of downtime per incident, with the highest disruptions reported in 2022, averaging 27 days.\nRebecca Moody, head of data research at Comparitech, noted the evolving nature of ransomware threats in healthcare.\n\"One of the most significant changes in ransomware attacks has been the increased focus on stealing large amounts of data,\" she said. \"If we look at the top 10 ransomware data breaches since 2018, seven of them occurred in 2023 and 2024.\"\nShe explained healthcare organizations are particularly vulnerable to ransomware attacks due to their reliance on operational continuity and sensitive patient data.\n\"Healthcare organizations can ill-afford downtime,\" Moody said. \"Losing access to systems can cause widespread chaos, delayed healthcare, and even errors in medication dispensing.\"\nShe said hackers often leverage this urgency, employing double-extortion tactics by encrypting systems while exfiltrating data to increase the pressure for ransom payments.\nMoody stressed that preparation is key to minimizing the impact of ransomware attacks.\n\"The key is being prepared for the worst-case scenario,\" she said. \"Having an incident response team, a communication plan, and clear instructions for managing threats and recovering data can help healthcare companies recover quickly.\"\nFrequent data backups are also essential to recovery efforts, but many organizations face challenges in implementing them due to budget constraints and gaps in employee training.\nAs ransomware tactics continue to evolve, Moody emphasized the importance of robust cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive patient data and maintain operational integrity. \n\"Having a plan in place can help hospitals and clinics maintain continuity of care, even during prolonged system outages,\" she said.\nThe report comes as Nebraska's Attorney General filed a lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries Change Healthcare and Optum following a ransomware attack that disrupted critical healthcare services across the state.\nHealthcare organizations are still struggling to get a handle on cybersecurity as threats explode and complexity of defense increases, with the rise of AI also causing concern.\n\n\n\n\nNathan Eddy is a healthcare and technology freelancer based in Berlin.\nEmail the writer: nathaneddy@gmail.com\nTwitter: @dropdeaded209\n\n\n Enterprise Taxonomy: ",

This classic, yet often overlooked technique can allow attackers to remove cookies from a target user and replace them with their own—leading to serious security risks like account takeovers. When combined with vulnerabilities like session fixation, the impact can be devastating.\n\n🔍 In this video, we’ll cover:\n\n- The theory behind cookie jar behavior and browser quirks.\n- How attackers manipulate session cookies using this technique.\n- A live demo of Cookie Jar Overflow in action, set up in a controlled lab environment.\n\nKey Concepts Explained:\nBrowsers have cookie limits (e.g., ~160-165 cookies in Chrome/Firefox). By flooding the cookie jar, attackers can push out important cookies (like session cookies) and inject their own. If the web app doesn't validate cookies properly, the attacker gains control. This attack is even more dangerous when paired with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\nOther Use Cases:\nCookie Jar Overflow isn’t just about session fixation. It can also be used for:\n- Cache poisoning with malicious cache keys.\n- Manipulating application state via cookie-stored flags.\n\nDon't miss out on this critical insight into a technique that could bypass traditional security defenses!

      "link": "https://www.businesstechworld.com/2024/12/mysk2-dyndns-org-explained-guide.html",
      "contentSnippet": " The world of Dynamic Domain Name System (DynDNS) services is vast, and various providers offer unique features to cater to the specific needs of users. One such provider is \"Mysk2 DynDNS Org,\" a name that has started to gain traction for offering flexible and robust services in the realm of dynamic DNS. This article will delve into the specifics of Mysk2 DynDNS Org, explaining what it is, how it works, its features, and its importance in modern networking. Additionally, we will answer some frequently asked questions (FAQs) to provide further clarity on this service.What is Mysk2 DynDNS Org?Mysk2 DynDNS Org is a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service provider that allows users to assign domain names to dynamic IP addresses. This service is particularly beneficial for individuals or businesses that have internet connections with dynamic IPs but still want to access their devices or services remotely through a stable domain name.Typically, an internet connection uses a dynamic IP address, meaning it changes periodically. This can create challenges for users who need to access their home or office network remotely, as the IP address is not constant. Mysk2 DynDNS Org solves this issue by providing users with a static domain name that automatically updates when the dynamic IP changes.Key Features of Mysk2 DynDNS Org1. Automatic IP UpdatesThe primary benefit of using Mysk2 DynDNS Org is the automatic update of IP addresses. When your IP address changes, Mysk2 DynDNS Org will automatically detect the change and update your domain name accordingly. This ensures you can access your devices without manually tracking or updating IP addresses.2. Custom Domain SupportMysk2 DynDNS Org allows users to set up custom domain names, making it easier for people to remember and access their services. Whether it’s for a personal website, server, or home surveillance system, you can create a subdomain (e.g., myserver.mysk2.dyndns.org) or even point a custom domain to your dynamic IP.3. Easy ConfigurationSetting up Mysk2 DynDNS Org is straightforward. Users only need to create an account, configure the router or the device to update the IP, and then link the domain to their IP address. There are many tutorials and guides available to help users with the setup process.4. Security FeaturesSecurity is a critical concern when dealing with remote access. Mysk2 DynDNS Org integrates security protocols to ensure the integrity of your data. It supports encrypted connections and provides options for securing access to your network.5. Device CompatibilityMysk2 DynDNS Org supports a wide range of devices, including routers, IP cameras, and home servers. It integrates seamlessly with many third-party applications, providing maximum flexibility for users with diverse needs.6. Low LatencyMysk2 DynDNS Org offers low-latency connections for faster and more reliable access to your network. This is especially useful for applications such as remote desktop access, IP surveillance, and online gaming.7. Multiple SubdomainsFor users with multiple devices or services that require dynamic DNS, Mysk2 DynDNS Org allows the creation of multiple subdomains under a single account. This is useful for people who want to access various services through different domain names but manage them all from one central dashboard.8. Free and Paid PlansMysk2 DynDNS Org offers both free and premium subscription options. While the free version provides basic functionality, paid plans unlock additional features such as more subdomains, custom domains, and enhanced support.How Does Mysk2 DynDNS Org Work?Dynamic DNS works by associating a domain name with a dynamic IP address. This association is maintained by periodically updating the DNS records as the IP address changes. In the case of Mysk2 DynDNS Org, the following steps illustrate how the system works:1. Dynamic IP AddressWhen you sign up for an internet connection, you are typically assigned a dynamic IP address by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This IP address is not fixed and can change at any time, depending on your ISP's policy.2. Creating an Account on Mysk2 DynDNS OrgTo get started, you need to sign up for an account on Mysk2 DynDNS Org. Once registered, you will be able to create a unique subdomain (e.g., mydevice.mysk2.dyndns.org).3. Router or Device ConfigurationOnce your account is set up, you need to configure your router or device to automatically update the dynamic DNS service with the current IP address. Many modern routers have built-in support for DDNS services like Mysk2 DynDNS Org. For those that do not, software solutions or scripts can be used to handle the task.4. IP Address DetectionMysk2 DynDNS Org uses special software or router integration to monitor your IP address. When the IP address changes (usually due to a router reset, a lease expiry, or other factors), the service automatically detects the change and updates the DNS records to reflect the new address.5. Accessing Your NetworkWith the DNS records updated, you can now use your custom domain name to access your network services remotely. For example, if you set up a server at home, you can access it by typing \"mydevice.mysk2.dyndns.org\" into a web browser or remote access software, without needing to know your dynamic IP address.6. MaintenanceMysk2 DynDNS Org also offers periodic maintenance to ensure that the DNS records remain up-to-date. This service reduces the need for manual intervention, keeping things running smoothly even as your IP address changes.Why is Mysk2 DynDNS Org Important?1. Remote Access to DevicesOne of the primary reasons for using Mysk2 DynDNS Org is to enable remote access to devices. Whether it’s accessing your home computer, media server, or surveillance camera system, Mysk2 ensures you can always reach your devices using a fixed domain name, even though your IP address is constantly changing.2.

By using this service, users can keep their server accessible through a consistent domain name.3. Cost-Effective SolutionFor small businesses or individuals who need a static IP address for their services but cannot afford the cost of a static IP from their ISP, Mysk2 DynDNS Org offers a low-cost solution. The free tier provides basic functionality, while the paid versions are still significantly cheaper than purchasing a dedicated static IP.4. Support for IoT DevicesWith the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, Mysk2 DynDNS Org plays a key role in allowing users to remotely access and control these devices. Whether it’s a smart home system or a security camera, Mysk2 helps provide access even when the underlying IP address changes.5.

Posted by James Forshaw, Google Project ZeroThis is a short blog post about some recent improvements I've been making to the OleView.NET tool which has been released as part of version 1.16. The tool is designed to discover the attack surface of Windows COM and find security vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation and remote code execution. The updates were recently presented at the Microsoft Bluehat conference in Redmond under the name \"DCOM Research for Everyone!\". This blog expands on the topics discussed to give a bit more background and detail that couldn't be fit within the 45-minute timeslot. This post assumes a knowledge of COM as I'm only going to describe a limited number of terms.Using the OleView.NET Tooling\n Before we start the discussion it's important to understand how you can get hold of the OleView.NET tool and some basic usage. The simplest way to get the tooling is to install it from the PowerShell gallery with the Install-Module OleViewDotNet command. This installs both the PowerShell module and the GUI. \n \n Next you need to parse the COM registration artifacts into an internal database. You can do this by running the Get-ComDatabase command. Once it's finished you're ready to go. You will notice that it can take a long time to complete, so it'd be annoying to have to do this every time you want to start researching. For that reason you can use the command Set-ComDatabase -Default to write out the database to a default storage location. Now the next time you start PowerShell you can just run an inspection command, such as Get-ComClass and the default database will be automatically loaded. \n \n This default database is also shared with the GUI, which you can start by running the Show-ComDatabase command. For general research I find the GUI to be easier to use and you can click around and look at the COM registration information. For analysis, the ability to script through PowerShell is more important.Researching COM Services\n Performing security research in COM usually involves the following steps::Enumerate potential COM classes of interest. These might be classes which are accessible outside of a sandbox, running at high privilege or designed to be remotely exposed.Validate whether the COM classes are truly accessible from the attack position. COM has various security controls which determine what users can launch, activate and access an object. Understanding these security controls allows the list of COM classes of interest to be limited to only those that are actually part of the attack surface.Enumerate exposed interfaces, determine what they do and call methods on them to test for security vulnerabilities.\n \n The last step is the focus of the updates to the tooling, making it easier to determine what an exposed interface does and call methods to test the behavior. The goal is to minimize the amount of reverse engineering needed (although generally some is still required) as well as avoid needing to write code outside of the tooling to interact with the COM service under test.\n \n To achieve this goal, OleView.NET will pull together any sources of interface information it has, then provide a mechanism to inspect and invoke methods on the interface through the UI or via PowerShell. The sources of information that it currently pulls together are:\n Known interfaces, either defined in the base .NET framework class libraries or inside OleView.NET.COM interface definitions present in the Global Assembly Cache.Registered type libraries.Windows Runtime interfaces.Extracted proxy class marshaling information.\n \n One useful benefit of gathering this information, is that the tool formats the interface as \"source code\" so you can manually inspect it.Formatting Interfaces Definitions\n The OleView.NET tool uses a database object to represent all the artifacts it has analyzed on your system. The latest released version defines some of these objects to be convertible to \"source code\". For example the following can be converted if the tool can determine some meta data that to represent the artifact:COM interfacesCOM proxiesCOM Windows Runtime classes.Type libraries, interfaces and classes.\n \n How you get to this conversion depends on whether you're using the PowerShell or the UI. The simplest approach is PowerShell, using the ConvertTo-ComSourceCode command. For example, the following will convert an interface object into source code:\n \n PS > Get-ComInterface -Name IMyInterface | ConvertTo-ComSourceCode -Parse\n \n Note that we also need to pass a -Parse option to the command. Some metadata such as type libraries and proxies can be expensive to parse so it won't do that automatically. However, once they're been parsed in the current session the metadata is cached for further use, so for example if you formatted a single interface in a type library, all other interfaces are now also parsed and can be formatted.\n \n The output of this command is the converted \"source code\" as text. The format depends on metadata source. For example the following is the output from a Windows Runtime type:\n \n [Guid(\"155eb23b-242a-45e0-a2e9-3171fc6a7fdd\")]\n interface IUserStatics\n {\n     /* Methods */\n     UserWatcher CreateWatcher();\n     IAsyncOperation FindAllAsync();\n     IAsyncOperation FindAllAsync(UserType type);\n     IAsyncOperation FindAllAsync(UserType type, \n                                        UserAuthenticationStatus status);\n     User GetFromId(string nonRoamableId);\n }\n \n As Windows Runtime types are defined using metadata similar to .NET then the output is a pseudo C# format. In contrast for type library or proxy it's look more like the following:\n \n [\n     odl,\n     uuid(00000512-0000-0010-8000-00AA006D2EA4),\n     dual,\n     oleautomation,\n     nonextensible\n ]\n interface _Collection : IDispatch {\n     [id(1), propget]\n     HRESULT Count([out, retval] int* c);\n     [id(0xFFFFFFFC), restricted]\n     HRESULT _NewEnum([out, retval] IUnknown** ppvObject);\n     [id(2)]\n     HRESULT Refresh();\n };\n \n This is in the Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL) format, the type library version should be pretty accurate and could even be recompiled by the MIDL compiler. For proxies some of the information is lost and so the MIDL generated isn't completely accurate, but as we'll see later there's limited reasons to take the output and recompile. \n \n Another thing to note is that proxies lose name information when compiled from MIDL to their C marshaled representation. Therefore the tool just generates placeholder names, for example, method names are of the form \"ProcN\". If the proxy is for a type that has a known definition, such as from a Windows Runtime type or a type library then the tool will try and automatically apply the names. If not, you'll need to manually change them if you want them to be anything other than the default.\n \n You can change the names from PowerShell by modifying the proxy object directly. For example the \"IBitsTest1\" interface looks like the following before doing anything:\n \n [\n   object,\n   uuid(51A183DB-67E0-4472-8602-3DBC730B7EF5),\n ]\n interface IBitsTest1 : IUnknown {\n     HRESULT Proc3([out, string] wchar_t** p0);\n }\n \n You can modify \"Proc3\" with the following script:\n \n PS > $proxy = Get-ComProxy -Iid 51A183DB-67E0-4472-8602-3DBC730B7EF5\n PS > $proxy.Procedures[0].Name = \"GetBitsDllPath\"\n PS > $proxy.Procedures[0].Parameters[0].Name = \"DllPath\"\n \n Now the formatted output looks like the following:\n \n [\n   object,\n   uuid(51A183DB-67E0-4472-8602-3DBC730B7EF5),\n ]\n interface IBitsTest1 : IUnknown {\n     HRESULT GetBitsDllPath([out, string] wchar_t** DllPath);\n }\n \n This renaming will also be important when we come back to calling proxied methods. Obviously it'd be annoying to run this script every time, so you can cache the names using the following command:\n PS > Export-ComProxyName -Proxy $p -ToCache\n \n This will write out a file describing the names to a local cache file. When the proxy is loaded again in another session this cache file will be automatically applied. The Export-ComProxyName and corresponding Import-ComProxyName commands allow you to read and write XML or JSON files representing the proxy names which you can modify in a text editor if that's easier.\n \n One of the quickest wins is to enumerate the interfaces for a COM object, then pass the output of that through the ConvertTo-ComSource code command. For example:\n \n PS > $obj = New-ComObject -Clsid 4575438f-a6c8-4976-b0fe-2f26b80d959e\n PS > Get-ComInterface -Object $obj | ConvertTo-ComSourceCode -Parse\n \n This creates a new COM object based on its CLSID, enumerates the interfaces it supports and then passes them through the conversion process to get out a \"source code\" representation of the interfaces.\n \n To view the source code in the GUI you first need to open one of the database views from the Registry menu. In the resulting window, there will be a tree view of artifacts. You need to open the source code viewer window by right clicking the tree and selecting the Show Source Code option in the context menu. This will result in a view similar to the following:\n \n \n \n You can also automatically enable the source code view from the View→Registry View Options menu. In that menu you can also enable automatically parsing the interface information, which is off by default. \n \n You might notice in the screenshot that there's some text which is underlined. This indicates names which can be changed, and it is only used for proxies. You can right click the name and choose Edit Name from the context menu to bring up a text entry dialog. You can then change the name to suit. If you want to persist the names between sessions then set the Save Proxy Names on Exit option in the registry view options. Then when you exit any modified proxies will be written to the cache.\n \n If you want to edit a proxy from PowerShell in a similar GUI you can use following command:\n \n PS > Edit-ComSourceCode $proxy\n \n This will show a dialog similar to the following where you can do edits to the proxy name information:\n \n \n Genering Interfaces from a Proxy Definition\n \n Now on to the more important side of these updates, the ability to invoke methods on the interfaces exposed by an object you want to research. The tool has always given you some ability to invoke methods as long as the object has a .NET interface to call through reflection. This could either be through a known interface type, such as a built-in one or the Windows Runtime interfaces or by converting a type library into a .NET assembly on demand.\n \n What's new is the ability to generate an interface based on a proxy definition and then use that to invoke methods. Initially I tried to implement this by generating an .NET interface dynamically which would then use the existing .NET interop to call the proxy methods. This worked fine for simple proxies but quickly hit problems when doing anything more complex:Some types are hard to represent in easy to use .NET types, such as pointers to structures. This is \"handled\" in the type library converter by just exporting them as IntPtr parameters which means the caller has to manually marshal the data. Get this wrong and the tool crashes.Any structures need to be accurately laid out so the native marshaler can read and write to the correct field locations. Get this wrong and the tool crashes.Did I mention that if you get this wrong the tool crashes?\n \n Fortunately I already had a solution, my sandbox library already had the ability to dynamically generate a .NET class from parsed NDR data, in fact I was already using the library to parse the NDR data for proxies so I realized could I repurpose the existing client builder for COM proxy clients. I needed to do some simple refactoring of the code to make it build from a COM proxy instance rather than an RPC server, but I quickly had an RPC client. This RPC client doesn't directly interact with any native marshaling code, so it's unlikely to crash. Also any complex structures are built in a way which makes it easy to modify from .NET removing the problems around pointers. One issue with using the RPC client method is the same interface could be used for both in-process and out-of-process objects. Due to the way COM is designed a client usually doesn't need to care about where the object is, but in this case it must be accessible via a proxy. This isn't that big an issue, there's no security boundary between in-process COM objects and so being able to call methods on them isn't that interesting.\n \n The next problem was the RPC transport. COM calls have an additional input and output parameter, the ORPTHIS and ORPCTHAT structures, that need to be added to the call. These parameters could have been added to the RPC client, but it would seem best to make the clients agnostic of the transport. Instead as my RPC code has pluggable RPC transport I was able to reimplement a custom version over the top of the existing ALPC and TCP transports which added the additional parameters to any call. That wasn't the end of it though, ALPC needs an additional pair of parameters, LocalThis and LocalThat, which are potentially different depending on versions of Windows. Also you need to add support for additional services such as the OXID resolver and communication with the local DCOM activator. While I implemented all this it wasn't as reliable as I'd like, however it's still present in the source code if you want to play with it. \n \n As an aside, I should point out that Clement Rouault, one of the original researchers into ALPC RPC protocol of which parts of my own implementation is inspired, recently released a very similar project for their Python tooling which implements the ALPC DCOM protocol.\n \n I decided that I'd need a different approach, in the COM runtime the RPC channel used by a proxy instance is represented by the IRpcChannelBuffer interface. An object implementing this interface is connected to the proxy during initialization, it is then used to send and receive NDR formatted data from the client to the server. The implementation handles all the idiosyncrasies such as the additional parameters, handling OXID resolving and reference counting. If we could get hold of a proxy object's instance of the IRpcChannelBuffer object, we could use that instead of implementing our own protocol, the challenge was how to get it.\n \n After a bit of research I found that we can use the documented NdrProxyInitialize function to get hold of the interface from its MIDL_STUB_MESSAGE structure by passing in the interface pointer to a proxy. While it wouldn't be as flexible as a fully custom implementation this gave me an easy way to handle the transport without worrying about platform or protocol differences. It could also work from an existing COM object, just query the appropriate interface, extract the buffer and make calls to the remote server.\n \n Of course nothing is that simple, I discovered that while the IRpcChannelBuffer object is a COM object it has a broken implementation of IMarshal. As .NET's COM interop tries to query for IMarshal when generating a Runtime Callable Wrapper, it will immediately crash the process. I had to manually dispatch the calls to the method through native delegates, but at least it works. \n Calling Interface Methods\n Okay, so how do you use the tool to call arbitrary methods? For the GUI it works like it always has, when you create an instance of a COM object, usually by right clicking an entry in a view and selecting Create Instance you'll get a new object information window similar to the following:\n \n \n \n At the bottom of the window is a list of supported interfaces. In the right column is an indicator if there's a viewer for that interface. If it's set to Yes, then you can double click it to bring up an invocation window like the following:\n \n \n \n From this window you can double click a method to bring up a new dialog where you can specify the arguments and invoke the method as shown below.\n \n \n \n Once invoked it'll show the resulting output parameters and if the return value is an integer will assume it's a HRESULT error code. These windows are the same for \"reflected\" interfaces such as type libraries and Windows Runtime interfaces as well as proxy clients. The names of proxy methods won't be automatically updated if you change them when the interface window is open. You'll need to go back to the object information window and double click the interface again to get it to recreate the client.\n \n For PowerShell you can specify an Iid argument when using the New-ComObject command or use the Get-ComObjectInterface command to query an existing COM object for a new interface. The tooling will pick the best option for calling the interface from the options available to it, including generating the RPC client dynamically. \n \n PS > $obj = New-ComObject -Clsid 4991D34B-80A1-4291-83B6-3328366B9097\n PS > $test = Get-ComObjectInterface $o -Iid 51A183DB-67E0-4472-8602-3DBC730B7EF5\n PS > $test.GetBitsDllPath()\n \n DllPath                      retval\n -------                      ------\n c:windowssystem32qmgr.dll      0\n \n To make it easier to call interface methods from PowerShell the exposed methods on the object will be modified to wrap output parameters in a single return value. You can see this in the listing above, the DllPath parameter was originally an output only parameter. Rather than deal with  that in the script a return structure was automatically created containing the DllPath as well as the HRESULT return value. If the parameter is an input and output then the method signature accepts the input value and the return value contains the output value.\n \n If the definitions for your interface don't already exist you can import them into the tool to be used by the automatic interface selection. To do this you'll need to define the interfaces as .NET types and compile them into an assembly. Then in the GUI use the File→Import Interop Assembly menu option or for PowerShell use the Add-ComObjectInterface command. Both of these options allow you to specify the assembly will be automatically loaded the next time you start the tool. This will make a copy of the DLL to a central location so that it can be accessed even if you delete the library later.\n \n If all you have is an IDL file for a set of COM interfaces you can import them into the tool indirectly with help from the Windows SDK. First compile the IDL file using the MIDL compiler to generate a type library, then use the TLBIMP command to generate an Assembly file from the type library. Finally you can import it using the previous paragraph's methods.\n \n There's plenty to discover in OleView.NET which I've not covered here. I'd encourage you to play around, or check out the source code on github.",

      "contentSnippet": "TechHive opened for business in 2012 as a general consumer tech site. In 2017, we narrowed the focus to smart home and video streaming, responding to the hottest new developments in personal tech. It’s been a great run, but today we’re announcing that all new TechHive content will be published to sister site PCWorld on a just-launched TechHive section.\n\n\n\nWhy the change? First, we want TechHive content to reach as many people as possible, and PCWorld simply has a much larger audience of tech enthusiasts, DIYers, and early adopters. PCWorld launched as a computer magazine in 1983 and became a web domain in 1992. You just can’t beat this kind of institutional legacy, and we’re confident that TechHive will use its new platform to reach many more people interested in home technology.\n\n\n\nSecond, in recent years PCWorld has made a deliberate push to expand its digital security content. And as digital security blends ever more closely with physical security, it just makes sense to fold TechHive’s smart home security content into PCWorld’s security story. So, please check out the new TechHive landing page for articles on security cameras, video doorbells, smart locks, smart lighting and more.\n\n\n\nYou’ll also find Jared Newman’s wildly popular Cord-Cutter Confidential column, along with other video streaming content that has helped define TechHive over the last seven years.\n\n\n\nThird, we’re relaunching the dormant TechHive YouTube channel! New videos have already gone live, and we’re planning for a steady stream of new product demos from CES 2025 in January.\n\n\n\nWe’ll be covering products and categories familiar to TechHive readers, while also expanding into more lifestyle-oriented home tech, plus health and wellness tech. We think this broader video vision is a great match for PCWorld, which has been speaking to early adopters throughout its 40-plus years of publishing.\n\n\n\nSo, once again, I invite you to check out the new TechHive hub. We’ve migrated much of TechHive security and streaming content to PCWorld already, and, going forward, all new TechHive content will appear on that page. Meanwhile, you can still access TechHive’s deep library of legacy content right here on this website.",

      "link": "https://www.techhive.com/article/579221/how-to-connect-a-soundbar-to-a-tv-without-hdmi-connectors.html",
      "contentSnippet": "While most modern soundbars rely on an HDMI cable to connect to HDTVs and 4K TVs, there are still plenty of soundbars on the market with legacy audio inputs that will work with older TVs—and yes, that includes many CRT (aka “tube”) TVs that are decades old.\n\n\n\nBy connecting an aging TV to a soundbar, you can give your older set a massive audio boost, complete with thumping bass and even virtualized 3D sound. And if your ancient flat-screen or tube TV has the right outputs, hooking it up to a new soundbar will be a snap.\n\n\n\nHere’s how to get started.\n\n\n\n1. Look for optical or RCA audio outputs\n\n\n\nThe first step is to check the back of your old TV to see what kind of audio outputs are available. If your aging TV lacks HDMI, the next best thing would be an optical (or Toslink) audio port, which has a squarish opening with a pair of small notches on each side. \n\n\n\nNot only can optical audio connections handle compressed (but not lossless) 5.1- and even 7.1-channel Dolby Digital and DTS sound, they’re also widely supported by the latest soundbars.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMany older TVs have at least analog stereo RCA audio outputs or even a multi-channel optical digital audio output.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo sign of an optical output? Then look for a stereo pair of RCA audio outputs, one for the left channel (commonly white and marked “L”) and a second for the right channel (commonly red and marked “R”). \n\n\n\nMany older TVs—even those as far back as the 1980s—will have these familiar-looking RCA plugs situated on their rear input/output panels, which can deliver analog stereo audio signals.\n\n\n\n2. Pick the right soundbar\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve determined that your older TV has either optical or RCA analog audio outputs, you’re ready to go soundbar shopping—and, if we may be so bold, your first stop should be our roundup of the best soundbars, where we have reviews of the best soundbars at various price levels.\n\n\n\nAs you’re shopping, keep an eye out for soundbars that have audio inputs that match your TV’s outputs. If your set has an optical audio output, good news: soundbars with optical inputs are (as we mentioned earlier) easy to find. That said, there are more and more soundbars (particularly newer ones) that have only HDMI ports, so be sure to look carefully.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nYou’ll find plenty of soundbars on the market with optical and 3.5mm analog audio inputs that will work with older TVs.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll see fewer current soundbars with an analog audio inputs than with optical connectors, but they’re still reasonably easy to find, particularly when it comes to budget soundbars in the sub-$200 range. \n\n\n\nWhat you’re looking for is a 3.5mm audio jack (generally labeled “AUX In”) that connects to the twin RCA connectors on your TV via a Y-shaped adapter cable (read on for help with picking the right cables).\n\n\n\n\nRelated: 10 things to consider when shopping for a soundbar\n\n\n\n\n3. Look for virtualized 3D sound modes\n\n\n\nBesides having the right connectors, you should also consider a soundbar with a virtual surround or 3D mode. Many of the latest soundbars have become remarkably adept at teasing surround and 3D audio–complete with height effects–out of 5.1- or even 2.0-channel audio sources. \n\n\n\nIn particular, DTS Virtual:X is impressively effective at tricking your ears into thinking they’re hearing sound from behind and even above your head, even when the original audio is only in stereo (which will be the case if your TV only has RCA-style analog audio outputs). And here’s the really good news: you can find DTS Virtual:X processing in soundbars that cost well south of $200.\n\n\n\n\nRelated: How virtual 3D audio is amping up the the latest soundbars\n\n\n\n\n4. Use the correct optical or 3.5mm-to-RCA cables\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve matched the optical and/or RCA-style audio outputs on your TV to the matching inputs on a soundbar, all you need to do is connect them using the proper cables. Most soundbar manufactures will include the proper optical cables (the ones that come with soundbars are generally quite short and thin) and RCA-to-3.5mm Y-cables.\n\n\n\nNo cables in the box? Don’t fret; both optical audio cables and RCA-to-3.5mm Y-cables are readily available through Amazon and other online retailers. Expect to spend about $15 or so for an optical cable, while RCA-to-3.5mm cables can be scooped up for less than $10.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOptical audio cables and RCA-to-3.5mm Y-cables (pictured) are readily available on Amazon, typically for less than $10 each.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Tweak your TV’s audio output settings\n\n\n\nYou might also need to make some adjustments to your TV’s audio settings. While some TVs may pipe sound through their audio-out ports automatically, others may require you to tinker with their audio settings Just start digging around in the TV’s settings menu.\n\n\n\nYou should also keep an eye out for a setting that switches your TV from “fixed” audio output (which will allow the soundbar to control the volume) to “variable” output (where the TV controls the volume). If the option exists, consider going for the “variable” setting, which means you won’t need to switch back and forth between your soundbar and TV remotes each time you want to adjust the volume.\n\n\n\nReady to shop for soundbars?

      "link": "https://www.techhive.com/article/582313/how-to-get-rid-of-hum-and-eliminate-other-noises-from-your-audio-and-video-systems.html",
      "contentSnippet": "So you just unboxed your new entertainment gear, hooked everything up, and you hear buzz, whine, hiss, chatter, or any number of other annoying noises that have been known to plague audio equipment. You might even see some banding or waves on your TV. So you take it all back to the store, only to watch the salesperson plug it in and have everything work perfectly. What’s going on here?\n\n\n\nYou might just need a simple ground loop isolator, like the $16 TII Network Technologies TII 220. Or if audible hum is your problem, the $80 EBTech Hum X will filter out the voltage in your ground line that’s causing it. Troubled by noise on your TV? An inexpensive ($10) Monoprice HDMI cable with a ferrite bead might do the trick. Yet another strategy is to plug all your gear into a line interactive uninterruptible power supply (UPS), such as the $250 Cyberpower CP1500PFCLCD. \n\n\nEliminate hum with the $80 EBTech HUM X\n\n\nOr you can bring out the big guns and power everything with a high-end isolation transformer. If a device like the $510 Tripplite IS1000HG can be trusted to protect and clean up the electricity feeding hospital equipment, it should be good enough for your home theater gear. \n\n\n\nThe problem could be bad wiring, defective equipment, or just a noisy electronic environment. Whatever the type of noise you’re hearing—and whatever the cause—we’ll help you identify it–and then show you how to get rid of it.\n\n\n\nCommon problem 1: Ground loops\n\n\n\nGround loops are the number-one cause of unusual audio noise and weird video, simply because it’s so darned easy to create. The most common manifestations are a loud buzz or hum coming through the speakers, or scrolling bands on a TV screen. It could also be a much quieter, yet equally annoying buzz or hum that you only hear when the room is otherwise quiet.\n\n\n\nA ground loop typically occurs when one or more pieces of your entertainment system are plugged into your home’s AC (alternating current) supply at different locations, and then connected together by electrical (versus optical) signal cables. RCA, HDMI, composite, component, and similar cables have shielding that’s connected to your home’s ground line. In the simplest terms, this creates a single-loop antenna that just loves to suck in various types of noise via electromagnetic induction. The illustration below shows how a ground loop can be created:\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tWhen you power inter-connected equipment from different AC outlets, you’re apt to create a ground loop: The ground will travel through the shielding of the signal cables.\n\n\n\n\nAnything that breaks the loop will remove the noise, and the easiest way to do it is to power everything through a single AC socket. As shown below, simply plug all your equipment into a single power strip, surge protector, or power center and plug that  into the wall. Problem solved. Most multimedia setups can be handled easily by a single 15-amp circuit.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tPowering connected equipment from the same AC socket will eliminate most ground loops. If you still get hum, see if your antenna or cable wire has its own ground connection.\n\n\n\n\nThere might be occasions where you simply can’t reach the same outlet with a piece of equipment. Self-powered speakers and subwoofers come to mind. You could just “pull the ground” by using a three-prong to two-prong adapter but this represents a potential shock hazard. Look up Les Harvey and Stone the Crows for an extreme example of what can happen with high-powered equipment.\n\n\nResolve coax cable ground loops with the $16 TII Network Technologies' TII 220\n\n\nIf an extension cord is impractical, a hum eliminator such as Ebtech’s Hum X should do the trick, and there are other products that do roughly the same thing, some of which interrupt the loop in the signal cables. If you have the skills, you can build your own hum eliminator for about $10 or $15. You’ll find plenty of information online that will show you how, but the task requires moderate skill with a soldering iron and similar tools.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEbtech’s Hum X eliminates ground loop noise safely. There are also DIY solutions online that are less expensive if you have the skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf those methods don’t fix things, the problem could be an over-the-air (OTA) antenna or a cable-TV coax cable that has its own path to ground. I’ve received some pretty annoying shocks when handling coax signal splitters. Normally—because of the isolation built into cable modems, cable boxes, and similar equipment—this will occur only if you’re connecting directly to the TV or to a video recorder.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve traced the problem to the TV signal wire that’s attached to a cable modem or similar (disconnect it and see if the problem goes away) replace that piece of equipment—there’s something wrong with it. If you’re connecting directly to a TV, there are ground-loop isolators available for less than $20.\n\n\n\nCommon problem 2: AC line noise\n\n\n\nGround loops are hardly the only thing that cause electrical noise; pretty much any device with a motor (hair dryers and blenders, for instance), as well as dimmer switches and failing fluorescent fixtures will create this type of interference. It might be audible through your audio equipment or visible on your TV, or it might not. The obvious solution for this type of noise is to not use those types of devices while you’re watching TV or listening to music. You might be able to make that work—if you live alone. If there are other people under the same roof, perhaps not. \n\n\nGet pristine AC power with a Tripp Lite SU1000XLCD UPS\n\n\nIf you’re willing to part with a few Benjamins, you can assure yourself of pristine AC without ground-loop noise by using a line interactive UPS (uninterruptible power supply) or an isolation transformer. A line interactive UPS is a battery-backup system with a battery that’s always engaged between the input AC and the output AC. This requires the electrical power to go through a conversion to DC (direct current) and then back to AC, which will remove all the noise. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tThis type of ground loop isolator, for coaxial cables used with over-the-air antennas and cable- and satellite-TV equipment, can eliminate both visual and audible noise.Amazon\n\n\n\nLine interactive UPSes are more expensive than the standby alternative, which keep switch to battery power on demand. Tripp Lite sent me its model SU1000XLCD UPS to clean up the super-dirty AC in my apartment. That device was selling for nearly $900 when I updated this article. It’s also heavy, about the size of a small dehumidifier, and it has some features (such as USB monitoring, so that it can gracefully shut down an attached computer in the event of a power failure) that have nothing to do with noise elimination. But darn if it isn’t 100 percent effective at providing protection against power surges and outages. The Tripp Lite IS1000HG isolation transformer I mentioned earlier will also clean up AC line noise. It costs several hundred dollars less, but doesn’t provide battery backup power.\n\n\nCondition your power with the Tripp Lite IS1000HG isolation transformer\n\n\nIt’s also much less-expensive than one of those high-end power conditioners you see marketed to gullible audiophiles. If you’re not worried about defeating ground-loop noise, you can get away for not much more than $100 with a UPS that advertises pure sine wave output.\n\n\n\nSlightly cheaper than an online UPS, but absolutely effective against all kinds of line noise is an isolation transformer. Tripplite sent me one of these as well: the excellent 1000-watt IS1000HG (Hospital Grade) with four outlets. It’s about $500, but you can easily get away with a lower wattage (500 or 250) model for less than $250. Note that I’ve seen much cheaper on Amazon, but not from a known vendor, so I can’t vouch for them.\n\n\n\nAn isolation transformer is one of those products whose name describes it to a tee—it employs a special, shielded transformer that turns dirty AC into clean AC via electromagnetic induction—yes, the same thing that causes ground-loop noise.\n\n\n\nIsolation transformers are designed for use with delicate diagnostic equipment, where even minimally noisy AC can cause spurious readings. That means they’re substantially more than adequate for multimedia setups.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tThe hospital-grade Tripp Lite IS1000HG isolation transformer is designed to eliminate any AC noise that could affect sensitive test equipment. Good enough for hospitals, good enough for your home theater.Tripp Lite\n\n\n\nCommon noise problem 3: Wires and cables\n\n\n\nThere are really only one or two hard and fast rules for cables and noise. The first is to never run a power cable across or near audio or video signal cables, including antenna wires. Modern signal cables are well shielded, but if you’re getting hum and it’s not a ground loop, this could well be the cause. Note that the cables running from a source device to self-powered speakers (i.e., not Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) are audio signal cables, not output cables.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tHDMI cables with ferrite beads filter the electronic signals traveling over the cable to block spurious current traveling through the cable’s shielding.Monoprice\n\n\n\nBalanced audio cables, meanwhile, consist of three wires: Two wires are used carry the signal instead of one, but the polarity of that signal is reversed on one wire. The third wire is used for grounding. This design renders balanced cables far less susceptible to power-cable hum and other electrical noises. If your equipment provides the option of using balanced cables–whether they be XLR or TRS (Tip/Ring/Sleeve)–take advantage of it.\n\n\n\nSpeaker cables have far stronger signals traveling along them, so they shouldn’t be as affected by RFI. But just to be safe, try to keep your AC cords isolated.\n\n\nKill HDMI noise with a $10 Monoprice cable with a ferrite bead\n\n\nThe other rule for wires is not looping antenna signal cables (twin-lead), which tends to induce the same noise by making them antennas themselves. Electromagnetic induction; it’s a blessing, it’s a curse (if you don’t know about it).\n\n\n\nAs to the quality of cables: A poorly made cable can cause noise issues, but there’s no real advantage to spending a fortune on them. A common misconception is that the more expensive the metal, the better the cable. Wrong. Gold is used on connectors because it doesn’t oxidize, not because it’s the best conductor of electricity. It’s quite good, better than nickel or chrome, but actually a bit worse than silver and copper. Forget platinum—it sounds sexy, but is about 20th down the conductivity list.\n\n\n\nCopper wire with gold connectors are the best combination; but again, don’t listen to the boutique audio sales propaganda. There are plenty of cables in the $10 to $20 range—or even lower—that will serve just as well.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tA line interactive uninterruptible power supply, like this CyberPower CP1500PFCLCD, continuously converts AC (alternating current) electrical power to DC (direct current) and then back to AC, removing all electrical noise in the process.Cyberpower\n\n\n\nOne thing you could check for, though it’s mostly an issue in high-impedance (higher gain/voltage, aka Hi-Z) applications, such as with guitar cables, is that they aren’t microphonic. Poor or loose shielding and other factors can actually turn physical shocks into audio signal. I’m not kidding. I’ve experienced this only once in my life with component-connecting cables and that was for a turntable. But if you’re noticing odd noises that seem to be in time with the bass or vibrations, give the signal cables a hard tap with a finger (with the equipment powered on) to see if this is a problem.\n\n\n\nOne more wire issue: size. While larger gauge wire can actually help an amp work a little easier and cooler when driving speakers by lowering cable impedance (resistivity), the impact on signal cables is negligible. That is, it’s inaudible to anyone who didn’t pay a lot for a fat wire and needs to hear a difference.\n\n\n\nCommon noise problem 4: RF interference\n\n\n\nEver wonder why the walls of your stereo receiver and other electronic devices are metal, when it seems like everything else in the world is made of plastic? It’s not for tensile strength, it’s to block incoming and outgoing RFI (radio frequency interference). Any conductive material tends to block RF signals and shunt their charge to its surface. Indeed, the shielding on cables works as a Faraday cage.\n\n\n\nSince it wouldn’t be practical to turn your home theater into Faraday cage, you should instead look to lessen the strength of the radio signals your A/V gear needs protection from. I’m talking portable phones, cell phones, Wi-Fi equipment, and even computers.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tThe red box in this photo identifies the balanced audio inputs on the back of a Yamaha HS-7 speaker. Many high-end DACs and audio interfaces have corresponding outputs. Balanced connections eliminate any noise induced into the signal traveling the cable.Yamaha\n\n\n\nComputers can generate a lot of RFI, which is why I shy away from cases with see-through plastic sides, which allow RFI to travel both ways. Wireless computer peripherals, such as mice and keyboards, can also cause interference. But if that happens, it’s a malfunction or bad design and the only fix is to replace them.\n\n\n\nBack to the point: Don’t be paranoid, but it’s not a bad idea to keep your RFI-emitting equipment as far away from your multimedia setup as you can. And if it’s a device that’s meant to be near your setup, make sure it’s adequately shielded.\n\n\n\nCommon noise problem 5: USB/HDMI cable noise\n\n\n\nI use external USB and Thunderbolt audio interfaces because they sound a lot better than anything you’ll find on a PC motherboard. Believe me: if my old ears can hear the difference, there is one. But when I first started using such gear, I would occasionally hear very faint static. For rather complicated reasons, current can leak into the shielding of USB cables which affects the signal. It’s annoying.\n\n\n\nThere are three methods for removing USB (and HDMI) cable noise. One is to use a cable with a ferrite noise suppressor sleeve (a slug of iron molded around the cable). You can also buy clip-on ferrite noise suppressors. These are sometimes called a ferrite bead.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tYou can modify your own audio and video cables to render them more noise proof by adding ferrite beads. This 10-pack costs about $13 at Amazon.VSKEY\n\n\n\nThe second method is to run a wire that’s less resistive than the USB/HDMI cable shielding from the case of the USB audio interface or HDMI audio component to your computer’s case. Speaker wire works fine for this. Electricity always follows the path of least resistance, so spurious current runs down the ground wire rather than the cable’s shield. This is also known as a ground shunt, or simply a shunt.\n\n\n\nThe third method is to get a USB noise filter (I’ve never seen one for HDMI, but an HDMI adapter could work), which is actually a USB re-transmitter that splits the shield connection. These cost around $50 and are said to indeed eliminate the noise. I’ve never used one, because the first and second methods are far cheaper and have never failed me.\n\n\nKill cable noise by attaching ferrite beads\n\n\nCommon noise problem 6: PC audio noise\n\n\n\nThe other reason I use external USB and Thunderbolt interfaces is that they simply aren’t subjected to as much RFI. Internal audio solutions, especially those that reside on a computer’s motherboard, are susceptible to all sorts of line noise and electromagnetic interference that can’t be eliminated. As you might have noticed, I just gave you the solution—go external USB or Thunderbolt. That said, there are PCI and PCIe cards that might also eliminate the problem, as well provide more outputs for gaming and surround.\n\n\n\nThe only good noise is the joyful noise you make\n\n\n\nAny combination of the approaches shown above should eliminate all the noise that’s not inherent in your audio system, as well as some you might have thought was inherent. But if you’re suffering a type of noise that I haven’t covered, or have a home-brew fix that works, please share it with us by leaving a comment on our Facebook page and/or emailing me at letters@techhive.com.\n\n\nSign up for the weekly Best of TechHive newsletter",

      "link": "http://security.googleblog.com/2024/12/google-cloud-expands-vulnerability.html",
      "contentSnippet": "Posted by Greg Mucci, Product Manager, Artifact Analysis, Oliver Chang, Senior Staff Engineering, OSV, and Charl de Nysschen, Product Manager OSVDevOps teams dedicated to securing their supply chain and predicting potential risks consistently face novel threats. Fortunately, they can now improve their image and container security by harnessing Google-grade vulnerability scanning, which offers expanded open-source coverage. A significant benefit of utilizing Google Cloud Platform is its integrated security tools, including Artifact Analysis. This scanning service leverages the same infrastructure that Google depends on to monitor vulnerabilities within its internal systems and software supply chains.Artifact Analysis has recently expanded its scanning coverage to eight additional language packages, four operating systems, and two extensively utilized base images, making it a more robust and versatile tool than ever before.   This enhanced coverage was achieved by integrating Artifact Analysis with the Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) platform and database. This integration provides industry-leading insights into open source vulnerabilities—a crucial capability as software supply chain attacks continue to grow in frequency and complexity, impacting organizations reliant on open source software.With these recent updates, customers can now successfully scan the vast majority of the images they push to Artifact Registry. These successful scans ensure that any known vulnerabilities are detected, reported, and can be integrated into a broader vulnerability management program, allowing teams to take prompt action.Open source vulnerabilities, with more reach Artifact Analysis pulls vulnerability information directly from OSV, which is the only open source, distributed vulnerability database that gets information directly from open source practitioners. OSV’s database provides a consistent, high quality, high fidelity database of vulnerabilities from authoritative sources who have adopted the OSV schema. This ensures the database has accurate information to reliably match software dependencies to known vulnerabilities—previously a difficult process reliant on inaccurate mechanisms such as CPEs (Common Platform Enumerations). Over the past three years, OSV has increased its total coverage to 28 language and OS ecosystems. For example, industry leaders such as GitHub, Chainguard, and Ubuntu, as well as open source ecosystems such as Rust and Python are now exporting their vulnerability discoveries in the OSV Schema. This increased coverage also includes Chainguard’s Wolfi images and Google’s Distroless images, which are popular choices for minimal container images used by many developers and organizations. Customers who rely on distroless images can count on Artifact Analysis scanning to support their minimal container image initiatives.  Each expansion in OSV’s coverage is incorporated into scanning tools that integrate with the OSV database.Broader vulnerability detection with Artifact Analysis As a result of OSV’s expansion, scanners like Artifact Analysis that draw from OSV now alert users to higher quality vulnerability information across a broader set of ecosystems—meaning GCP project owners will be made aware of a more complete set of vulnerability findings and potential security risks. Existing Artifact Registry scanning customers don't need to take any action to take advantage of this update. Projects that have scanning enabled will immediately benefit from this expanded coverage and vulnerability findings will continue to be available in the Artifact Registry UI, Container Analysis API, and via pub/sub (for workflows).Existing On Demand scanning customers will also benefit from this expanded vulnerability coverage. All the same Operating Systems and Language package coverage that Registry Scanning customers enjoy are available in On Demand Scan. Beyond Artifact Registry We know that detection is just one of the first steps necessary to manage risks. We’re continually expanding Artifact Analysis capabilities and in 2025 we’ll be integrating Artifact Registry vulnerability findings with Google Cloud’s Security Command Center. Through Security Command Center customers can maintain a more comprehensive vulnerability management program, and prioritize risk across a number of different dimensions. ",

      "contentSnippet": "Posted by Hyunwook Baek, Duy Truong, Justin Dunlap and Lauren Stan from Android Security and Privacy, and Oliver Chang with the Google Open Source Security TeamToday, we are announcing the availability of Vanir, a new open-source security patch validation tool. Introduced at Android Bootcamp in April, Vanir gives Android platform developers the power to quickly and efficiently scan their custom platform code for missing security patches and identify applicable available patches. Vanir significantly accelerates patch validation by automating this process, allowing OEMs to ensure devices are protected with critical security updates much faster than traditional methods. This strengthens the security of the Android ecosystem, helping to keep Android users around the world safe. By open-sourcing Vanir, we aim to empower the broader security community to contribute to and benefit from this tool, enabling wider adoption and ultimately improving security across various ecosystems. While initially designed for Android, Vanir can be easily adapted to other ecosystems with relatively small modifications, making it a versatile tool for enhancing software security across the board. In collaboration with the Google Open Source Security Team, we have incorporated feedback from our early adopters to improve Vanir and make it more useful for security professionals. This tool is now available for you to start developing on top of, and integrating into, your systems.The Android ecosystem relies on a multi-stage process for vulnerability mitigation. When a new vulnerability is discovered, upstream AOSP developers create and release upstream patches. The downstream device and chip manufacturers then assess the impact on their specific devices and backport the necessary fixes. This process, while effective, can present scalability challenges, especially for manufacturers managing a diverse range of devices and old models with complex update histories. Managing patch coverage across diverse and customized devices often requires considerable effort due to the manual nature of backporting.To streamline the vital security workflow, we developed Vanir. Vanir provides a scalable and sustainable solution for security patch adoption and validation, helping to ensure Android devices receive timely protection against potential threats.The power of VanirSource-code-based static analysis Vanir’s first-of-its-kind approach to Android security patch validation uses source-code-based static analysis to directly compare the target source code against known vulnerable code patterns. Vanir does not rely on traditional metadata-based validation mechanisms, such as version numbers, repository history and build configs, which can be prone to errors. This unique approach enables Vanir to analyze entire codebases with full history, individual files, or even partial code snippets. A main focus of Vanir is to automate the time consuming and costly process of identifying missing security patches in the open source software ecosystem. During the early development of Vanir, it became clear that manually identifying a high-volume of missing patches is not only labor intensive but also can leave user devices inadvertently exposed to known vulnerabilities for a period of time. To address this, Vanir utilizes novel automatic signature refinement techniques and multiple pattern analysis algorithms, inspired by the vulnerable code clone detection algorithms proposed by Jang et al. [1] and Kim et al. [2]. These algorithms have low false-alarm rates and can effectively handle broad classes of code changes that might appear in code patch processes. In fact, based on our 2-year operation of Vanir, only 2.72% of signatures triggered  false alarms. This allows Vanir to efficiently find missing patches, even with code changes, while minimizing unnecessary alerts and manual review efforts. Vanir's source-code-based approach also enables rapid scaling across any ecosystem. It can generate signatures for any source files written in supported languages. Vanir's signature generator automatically generates, tests, and refines these signatures, allowing users to quickly create signatures for new vulnerabilities in any ecosystem simply by providing source files with security patches. Android’s successful use of Vanir highlights its efficiency compared to traditional patch verification methods. A single engineer used Vanir to generate signatures for over 150 vulnerabilities and verify missing security patches across its downstream branches – all within just five days.Vanir for AndroidCurrently Vanir supports C/C++ and Java targets and covers 95% of Android kernel and userspace CVEs with public security patches. Google Android Security team consistently incorporates the latest CVEs into Vanir’s coverage to provide a complete picture of the Android ecosystem’s patch adoption risk profile. The Vanir signatures for Android vulnerabilities are published through the Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) database. This allows Vanir users to seamlessly protect their codebases against latest Android vulnerabilities without any additional updates. Currently, there are over 2,000 Android vulnerabilities in OSV, and finishing scanning an entire Android source tree can take 10-20 minutes with a modern PC.Flexible integration, adoption and expansion.Vanir is developed not only as a standalone application but also as a Python library. Users who want to integrate automated patch verification processes with their continuous build or test chain may easily achieve it by wiring their build integration tool with Vanir scanner libraries. For instance, Vanir is integrated with a continuous testing pipeline in Google, ensuring all security patches are adopted in ever-evolving Android codebase and their first-party downstream branches.Vanir is also fully open-sourced, and under BSD-3 license. As Vanir is not fundamentally limited to the Android ecosystem, you may easily adopt Vanir for the ecosystem that you want to protect by making relatively small modifications in Vanir. In addition, since Vanir’s underlying algorithm is not limited to security patch validation, you may modify the source and use it for different purposes such as licensed code detection or code clone detection. The Android Security team welcomes your contributions to Vanir for any direction that may expand its capability and scope. You can also contribute to Vanir by providing vulnerability data with Vanir signatures to OSV.Vanir ResultsSince early last year, we have partnered with several Android OEMs to test the tool’s effectiveness. Internally we have been able to integrate the tool into our build system continuously testing against over 1,300 vulnerabilities. Currently Vanir covers 95% of all Android, Wear, and Pixel vulnerabilities with public fixes across Android Kernel and Userspace. It has a 97% accuracy rate, which has saved our internal teams over 500 hours to date in patch fix time.Next stepsWe are happy to announce that Vanir is now available for public use. Vanir is not technically limited to Android, and we are also actively exploring problems that Vanir may help address, such as general C/C++ dependency management via integration with OSV-scanner. If you are interested in using or contributing to Vanir, please visit github.com/google/vanir. Please join our public community to submit your feedback and questions on the tool. We look forward to working with you on Vanir!",

      "contentSnippet": "Ready to give your streaming video setup a boost? There’s no better time than Cyber Monday to trade up for a new and improved streaming video player, and we’ve spotted some enticing deals on streaming devices from Amazon and Roku.\n\n\n\nAmazon is serving up deals on its latest streaming devices, including the just-released Fire TV Stick HD and Fire TV Stick 4K, while Roku is offering discounts on its popular Streaming Stick 4K, Express 4K+, and more.\n\n\n\nWe’re also keeping an eye out for Cyber Monday deals for the Apple TV 4K, Nvidia Shield, and Google Chromecast (including the new Google TV Streamer). We’ll update our list as more deals go live.\n\n\n\nUpdated December 2, 2024: We’ve added the latest streaming video player deals. Also, be sure to check out Cyber Monday discounts on home security cameras, video doorbells, Philips Hue smart lights, and more! \n\n\n\nBest Black Friday deals on Amazon Fire TV streaming players\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick HD, $17.99 on Amazon (49% off)\n\n\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K, $21.99 on Amazon (56% off)\n\n\n\nAmazon Fire TV Cube (3rd gen), $99.99 on Amazon (29% off)\n\n\n\n\nBoth the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD and the Fire Stick 4K were released barely a month ago, meaning the latest generations of those streaming players are already getting big Black Friday discounts (particularly the Fire TV Stick 4K). \n\n\n\nYou can also nab a solid deal on the Fire TV Cube, which is capable of controlling your cable box with voice commands (courtesy of Alexa).\n\n\n\nBest Black Friday deals on Roku streaming players\n\n\n\n\nRoku Express 4K+, $24 on Amazon (40% off)\n\n\n\nRoku Streaming Stick 4K, $29 on Amazon (42% off)\n\n\n\nRoku Ultra LT, $57 on Amazon (19% off)\n\n\n\nRoku Ultra (2024), $79 on Amazon (21% off)\n\n\n\nRoku Streambar SE, $69 on Amazon (31% off)\n\n\n\n\nJust $24 for the Roku Express 4K+ streamer is a terrific price, while the discounted Roku Streaming Stick 4K ups the ante with Dolby Vision support for just five bucks more. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Roku’s top-of-the-line Ultra–now with a backlit remote–is getting a Black Friday price cut, or you can opt for the Ultra LT, which shaves off a few features (namely a USB port) and includes a more basic remote for even less. \n\n\n\nFinally, the Roku Streambar SE is a compact soundbar with a built-in Roku streaming player, and it’s priced to move for Black Friday.\n\n\n\nIt’s worth noting that we skipped Roku’s cheapest players, the Roku LE and the Roku Express. As our columnist Jared Newman noted, they’re simply not very good players for the price, and you can do much better spending just a few dollars more for our picks.\n\n\n\n Black Friday streaming player deals: What you need to know \n1.\nWhen is Black Friday?\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the biggest shopping day in the U.S., Black Friday lands on the day after Thanksgiving–and this year, the big day comes on November 29, 2024.\n\n\n\nOf course, Black Friday deals will start popping up well before the actual day, and they’ll generally continue through the weekend, leading up to Cyber Monday. \n\n\n\n\n\n2.\nWhat is Cyber Monday? \n\n\n\n\nA relatively new addition to the end-of-the-year shopping season, Cyber Monday hits the first Monday after Black Friday. For 2024, that means Monday, December 2.\n\n\n\nThe idea behind Cyber Monday was that it was a day of discounts for online shoppers, versus the in-person shopping spree that Black Friday used to be. Now, both shopping days are mostly about pointing and clicking.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\nWill there be streaming video player deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday?\n\n\n\n\nMost definitely, with Amazon and Roku generally serving up the most streaming video deals.\n\n\n\nWe also expect to see discounts on Google’s Chromecast players, while on rare occasions, Apple and Nvidia will cut prices on their Apple TV 4K and Nvidia Shield devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\nDo you have to be an Amazon Prime member to get Black Friday discounts?\n\n\n\n\nUnlike Prime Day, most Black Friday deals on Amazon are open to all shoppers, although you’ll need to be a Prime member to get free shipping. Amazon discloses which deals are limited to Prime members.\n\n\n\nYou can get Amazon Prime for $14.99 a month, or $139 a year, and your membership includes a variety of benefits, including free shipping for Prime items, access to Prime Video, Amazon Music, Prime Reading, and more.\n\n\n\nNaturally, Prime isn’t needed when shopping at non-Amazon retailers, such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\nSpeaking of which, will other retailers offer their own Black Friday discounts? \n\n\n\n\nOf course! Be sure to keep an eye on Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and other online stores as Black Friday and Cyber Monday progress.",

\n Posted by Ivan Fratric, Google Project Zero\n Recently, one of the projects I was involved in had to do with video decoding on Apple platforms, specifically AV1 decoding. On Apple devices that support AV1 video format (starting from Apple A17 iOS / M3 macOS), decoding is done in hardware. However, despite this, during decoding, a large part of the AV1 format parsing happens in software, inside the kernel, more specifically inside the AppleAVD kernel extension (or at least, that used to be the case in macOS 14/ iOS 17). As fuzzing is one of the techniques we employ regularly, the question of how to effectively fuzz this code inevitably came up.\n \n It should be noted that I wasn’t the first person to look into the problem of Apple kernel extension fuzzing, so before going into the details of my approach, other projects in this space should be mentioned.\n \n In the Fairplay research project, @pwn0rz utilized a custom loader to load the kernel extension into userspace. A coworker tried to run this code on the current AppleAVD extension, however it didn’t work for them (at least not out of the box) so we didn’t end up using it. It should be noted here that my approach also loads the kernel code into userspace, albeit in a more lightweight way.\n \n In the Cinema time! presentation at Hexacon 2022, Andrey Labunets and Nikita Tarakanov presented their approach for fuzzing AppleAVD where the decompiled code was first extracted using IDA and then rebuilt. I used this approach in the past in some more constrained scenarios, however the decompiled code from IDA is not perfect and manual fixing was often required (such as, for example, when IDA would get the stack layout of a function incorrectly).\n \n In the KextFuzz project, Tingting Yin with the co-authors statically instrumented kernel extensions by replacing pointer authentication instructions with a jump to a coverage-collecting trampoline, which results in a partial coverage.\n \n Most recently, the Pishi project by Meysam Firouzi was released just before this research. The project statically instruments kernel extension code by using Ghidra to identify all basic blocks, and then replacing one instruction from each basic block with a branch to a dedicated trampoline. The trampoline records the coverage, executes the replaced instruction and jumps back to the address of the next instruction. This was reported to run on a real device.\n \n Given the existence of these other projects, it is worth saying that my goal was not to create necessarily the “best” method for kernel extension fuzzing, but what for me was the simplest (if we don’t count the underlying complexity of the off-the shelf tools being used). In short, my approach, that will be discussed in detail in other sections, was\n Load AppleAVD extension or full kernelcache into IDARebase the module to an address that can be reliably allocated in userspaceExport raw memory using an IDA Python scriptLoad exported bytes using custom loaderUse custom TinyInst module to hook and instrument the extensionUse Jackalope for fuzzing\n \n All the project code can be found here. Various components will be explained in more detail throughout the rest of the blog post.Extracting kernel extension code\n Normally, on macOS, kernel extensions are packaged inside “kernel collections” files that serve as containers for multiple extensions. At first OS boot (and whenever something is changed with regards to kernel extensions), the kernel extensions needed by the machine are repackaged into what is called the “kernel cache” (kernelcache file on the filesystem). Kernel extensions can be extracted from these caches and collections, but existing tooling can’t really produce individual .dylib files that can be loaded into userspace and run without issues.\n \n However, reverse engineering tooling, specifically IDA Pro which I used in this research, comes with a surprisingly good loader for Apple kernel cache. I haven’t tried how other reverse engineering tools compare, but if they are comparable and someone would like to contribute to the project, I would gladly accept export scripts for these other tools.\n \n So, instead of writing our own loader, we can simply piggyback on IDA’s. The idea is simple:we let IDA load the kernel extension we want (or even the entire kernelcache)we use IDA to rebase the code so it’s in memory range that is mappable in userspace (see image)using a simple IDA Python script, we export for each memory segment its start address, end address, protection flags and raw bytesoptionally, we can also, using the same script, export all the symbol names and the corresponding addresses so we can later refer to symbols by name\n \n The following image shows rebasing of the kernel extension. This functionality is accessible in IDA via Edit- >Segments- >Rebase program… menu. When choosing the new base address, it is convenient to only change the high bits which makes it easy to manually convert rebased to original addresses and vice versa when needed. In the example below the image base was changed from 0xFFFFFE000714C470 to  0xAB0714C470.\n \n \n Figure 1: Rebasing the extension\n \n The IDA script for exporting the data can be found here. You can run it using the following commands in IDA:\n \n sys.path.append('/directory/containing/export/script')\n import segexport\n segexport.export('/path/to/output/file)Loading and running\n Loading the exported data should now be only the matter of memory mapping the correct addresses and copying the corresponding data from the exported file. You can see it in the load() function here.\n \n However, since we are now loading and running kernel code in userspace, there will be functions that won’t run well or that we would want to change. One example for this are the kernel allocator functions that we’ll want to replace with the system malloc.\n \n One way of replacing these functions would be to rewrite the prolog of each function we want to replace with a jump to its replacement. However, since we will later be using TinyInst to extract code coverage, there is a simpler way. We will simply write a breakpoint instruction to each function we want to replace. Since TinyInst is (among other things) a debugger, it will catch each of these breakpoints and, from the TinyInst process, we can replace the instruction pointer with the address of the corresponding replacement function. More details on this can be found in the next section.\n \n Besides replacing the memory allocation functions, logging functions etc., we will also need to replace all functions that interact with the hardware that we can’t access from userspace (or, in our case, that isn’t even present on the machine). In the case of AV1 parsing code in the AppleAVD kernel extension, a function called AppleAVD::sendCommandToCommandGate gets called, which I assume is meant to communicate with the decoding hardware. Thus, as a part of the harness, this function was replaced with a function that always returns 0 (success).\n \n The final code of the AV1 harness code can be found here. It can be compiled as\n \n clang++ loader.cpp avdharness.cpp -oloader\n \n and might need some additional entitlements to run which can be applied with\n \n codesign --entitlements entitlements.txt -f -s - ./loader\n \n Note that, in the harness code, although I tried to rely on symbol names instead of hardcoded offsets wherever possible, it still contains some struct offsets. This version of the harness was based on macos 14.5 kernel, which was the most recent OS version at the time the loader was written.Writing a custom TinyInst module\n This section explains the custom TinyInst module that accompanies the loader (and is required for the correct functioning of the loader). This code doesn’t contain anything specific for a particular kernel extension and thus can be reused as is. If you are not interested in how it works or writing custom TinyInst modules, then you can skip this section.\n \n Firstly, since we will want to extract code coverage for the purposes of fuzzing, we will base our custom module on LiteCov, the “default” TinyInst module for code coverage:\n \n class AVDInst : public LiteCov {\n   …\n };\n \n Secondly, we need a way for our custom loader to communicate with the TinyInst moduleIt needs to tell TinyInst which functions in the kext should be replaced with which replacement functions.It needs to tell TinyInst where the kext was loaded so that TinyInst can instrument it.\n \n While TinyInst provides an API for function hooking that we could use here, there is also a more direct (albeit, also more low-level) way. From our loader, we will simply call a function at some hardcoded non-mapped address. This will, once again, cause an exception that TinyInst (being a debugger) will catch, read the parameters from registers, do the required action and “return” (by replacing the instruction pointer with the value inside the link register). The loader uses the hardcoded address 0x747265706C616365 to register a replacement and 0x747265706C616366 to tell TinyInst about the address range to instrument:\n \n #define TINYINST_REGISTER_REPLACEMENT 0x747265706C616365\n #define TINYINST_CUSTOM_INSTRUMENT 0x747265706C616366\n \n We can catch those in the exception handler of our custom module\n \n bool AVDInst::OnException(Exception *exception_record) {\n   …\n   if(exception_address == TINYINST_REGISTER_REPLACEMENT) {\n     RegisterReplacementHook();\n     return true;\n   }\n \n   if(exception_address == TINYINST_CUSTOM_INSTRUMENT) {\n     InstrumentCustomRange();\n     return true;\n   }\n   …\n }\n \n and then read the parameters and do the required action\n \n void AVDInst::RegisterReplacementHook() {\n   uint64_t original_address = GetRegister(X0);\n   uint64_t replacement_address = GetRegister(X1);\n \n   redirects[original_address] = replacement_address;\n \n   SetRegister(ARCH_PC, GetRegister(LR));\n }\n \n void AVDInst::InstrumentCustomRange() {\n   uint64_t min_address = GetRegister(X0);\n   uint64_t max_address = GetRegister(X1);\n \n   InstrumentAddressRange(\"__custom_range__\", min_address, max_address);\n \n   SetRegister(ARCH_PC, GetRegister(LR));\n }\n \n Where InstrumentAddressRange is a recently added TinyInst function that will instrument all code between addresses given in its parameters. “__custom_range__” is simply a name that we give to this region of memory so we can differentiate between multiple instrumented modules (if there are more than one).\n \n Next, TinInst needs to perform the actual function replacements. As explained above, this can be done in the exception handler of our module.\n \n   auto iter = redirects.find(exception_address);\n   if(iter != redirects.end()) {\n     // printf(\"Redirecting...n\");\n     SetRegister(ARCH_PC, iter- >second);\n     return true;\n   }\n \n This is mostly sufficient for running the kernel extension without instrumenting it (e.g. to collect coverage). However, if we also want to instrument the extension, then the process of instrumentation involves rewriting the extension code in another location and inserting e.g. additional instructions to record coverage. The consequence of this is that our breakpoint instructions (that we inserted for the purpose of redirects) will be rewritten at different addresses. We need to make TinyInst aware of this (as a side note, TinyInst Hook API does this under the hood, but it wasn’t used in this module). We can do this in the InstrumentInstruction function which gets called for every instruction as it’s being instrumented:\n \n InstructionResult AVDInst::InstrumentInstruction(ModuleInfo *module,\n                                         Instruction& inst,\n                                         size_t bb_address,\n                                         size_t instruction_address)\n {\n   auto iter = redirects.find(instruction_address);\n   if(iter != redirects.end()) {\n     instrumented_redirects[assembler_- >Breakpoint(module)] = iter- >second;\n     return INST_STOPBB;\n   }\n \n   return LiteCov::InstrumentInstruction(module, inst, bb_address, instruction_address);\n }\n \n The INST_STOPBB return value tells TinyInst to stop processing the current basic blocks. Since on breakpoints/redirects, we redirect the execution to another function, no other instructions from the same basic block ever get executed and are thus unneeded.\n \n After this, we now know the addresses of breakpoints (and the corresponding replacements) in both instrumented and non-instrumented code. The final exception handler of our custom module looks like this:\n \n bool AVDInst::OnException(Exception *exception_record) {\n   size_t exception_address;\n \n   if(exception_record- >type == BREAKPOINT)\n   {\n     exception_address = (size_t)exception_record- >ip;\n   } else if(exception_record- >type == ACCESS_VIOLATION) {\n     exception_address = (size_t)exception_record- >access_address;\n   } else {\n     return LiteCov::OnException(exception_record);\n   }\n \n   if(exception_address == TINYINST_REGISTER_REPLACEMENT) {\n     RegisterReplacementHook();\n     return true;\n   }\n \n   if(exception_address == TINYINST_CUSTOM_INSTRUMENT) {\n     InstrumentCustomRange();\n     return true;\n   }\n \n   auto iter = redirects.find(exception_address);\n   if(iter != redirects.end()) {\n     // printf(\"Redirecting...n\");\n     SetRegister(ARCH_PC, iter- >second);\n     return true;\n   }\n \n   iter = instrumented_redirects.find(exception_address);\n   if(iter != instrumented_redirects.end()) {\n     // printf(\"Redirecting...n\");\n     SetRegister(ARCH_PC, iter- >second);\n     return true;\n   }\n \n   return LiteCov::OnException(exception_record);\n }\n \n The entire code, with all the housekeeping functions can be found here.Fuzzing and findings\n Once our custom module is ready, we still need to make sure TinyInst and Jackalope will use this module instead of the default LiteCov module. See the appropriate patches for TinyInst and Jackalope.\n \n Our harness should now run correctly under TinyInst, both without and with coverage instrumentation:\n \n ./Jackalope/build/TinyInst/Release/litecov -- ./loader avd_rebased.dat -f \n \n Where avd_rebased.dat contains the kernel extension code exported from IDA. We can also add the -trace_basic_blocks flag to trace basic blocks as they are being executed (primarily useful for debugging). We can also run a fuzzing session with Jackalope like this:\n \n ./Jackalope/build/Release/fuzzer -in in -out out -t 1000 -delivery shmem -target_module loader -target_method __Z4fuzzPc -nargs 1 -iterations 5000 -persist -loop -cmp_coverage -mute_child -nthreads 6 -- ./loader avd_rebased.dat -m @@\n \n This tells jackalope to run in persistent mode (with the function “fuzz” being looped), with sample delivery over shared memory (-delivery shmem fuzzer flag and -m being implemented in the harness code).\n \n Fuzzing is useful not only for finding bugs in the target, but in our case also for finding bugs in the harness, e.g. finding other kernel functions we need to replace in order for the target to work correctly.\n \n After several iterations of fixups, the harness appeared to be working correctly. However, the fuzzer also caught some crashes that appeared to have been caused by genuine issues in the AV1 parsing code. I did a root cause analysis and reported the issues to Apple. The reports can be seen in the following entries in the Project Zero issue tracker:\n AppleAVD: Large OBU size in AV1_Syntax::Parse_Header reading to out-of-bounds readsAppleAVD: Issue with AV1_Syntax::f leading to out-of-bounds readsAppleAVD: Integer underflow in AV1_Syntax::Parse_Header leading to out-of-bounds reads\n \n Unfortunately, at the time of reporting these issues I still didn’t have access to a machine with AV1 decoding capabilities. Thus, instead of full end-to-end PoCs, the issues were reported in the form of a full root cause analysis and a binary stream that causes a crash when used as a parameter to a particular decoding function. Eventually, we did get a Macbook with a M3 chip that supports AV1 hardware decoding and tried to reproduce the reported issues. Unsurprisingly, all three issues reproduced exactly the same on the real hardware as in the userspace harness.Conclusion\n The goal of this project was to create userspace kernel extension fuzzing tooling that was as simple as possible, and at least one of the reasons for this simplicity was that it could be easily adapted to other pieces of kernel code. The process is versatile enough that it allowed us to fuzz AV1 parsing code that normally requires hardware we didn’t even have at the time. While the three issues found during this research are not critical, they demonstrate the correctness of the approach and the potential for finding other issues.",

      "contentSnippet": "Posted by Oliver Chang, Dongge Liu and Jonathan Metzman, Google Open Source Security TeamRecently, OSS-Fuzz reported 26 new vulnerabilities to open source project maintainers, including one vulnerability in the critical OpenSSL library (CVE-2024-9143) that underpins much of internet infrastructure. The reports themselves aren’t unusual—we’ve reported and helped maintainers fix over 11,000 vulnerabilities in the 8 years of the project. But these particular vulnerabilities represent a milestone for automated vulnerability finding: each was found with AI, using AI-generated and enhanced fuzz targets. The OpenSSL CVE is one of the first vulnerabilities in a critical piece of software that was discovered by LLMs, adding another real-world example to a recent Google discovery of an exploitable stack buffer underflow in the widely used database engine SQLite.This blog post discusses the results and lessons over a year and a half of work to bring AI-powered fuzzing to this point, both in introducing AI into fuzz target generation and expanding this to simulate a developer’s workflow. These efforts continue our explorations of how AI can transform vulnerability discovery and strengthen the arsenal of defenders everywhere.The story so farIn August 2023, the OSS-Fuzz team announced AI-Powered Fuzzing, describing our effort to leverage large language models (LLM) to improve fuzzing coverage to find more vulnerabilities automatically—before malicious attackers could exploit them. Our approach was to use the coding abilities of an LLM to generate more fuzz targets, which are similar to unit tests that exercise relevant functionality to search for vulnerabilities. The ideal solution would be to completely automate the manual process of developing a fuzz target end to end:Drafting an initial fuzz target.Fixing any compilation issues that arise. Running the fuzz target to see how it performs, and fixing any obvious mistakes causing runtime issues.Running the corrected fuzz target for a longer period of time, and triaging any crashes to determine the root cause.Fixing vulnerabilities. In August 2023, we covered our efforts to use an LLM to handle the first two steps. We were able to use an iterative process to generate a fuzz target with a simple prompt including hardcoded examples and compilation errors. In January 2024, we open sourced the framework that we were building to enable an LLM to generate fuzz targets. By that point, LLMs were reliably generating targets that exercised more interesting code coverage across 160 projects. But there was still a long tail of projects where we couldn’t get a single working AI-generated fuzz target.To address this, we’ve been improving the first two steps, as well as implementing steps 3 and 4.New results: More code coverage and discovered vulnerabilitiesWe’re now able to automatically gain more coverage in 272 C/C++ projects on OSS-Fuzz (up from 160), adding 370k+ lines of new code coverage. The top coverage improvement in a single project was an increase from 77 lines to 5434 lines (a 7000% increase).This led to the discovery of 26 new vulnerabilities in projects on OSS-Fuzz that already had hundreds of thousands of hours of fuzzing. The highlight is CVE-2024-9143 in the critical and well-tested OpenSSL library. We reported this vulnerability on September 16 and a fix was published on October 16. As far as we can tell, this vulnerability has likely been present for two decades and wouldn’t have been discoverable with existing fuzz targets written by humans.Another example was a bug in the project cJSON, where even though an existing human-written harness existed to fuzz a specific function, we still discovered a new vulnerability in that same function with an AI-generated target. One reason that such bugs could remain undiscovered for so long is that line coverage is not a guarantee that a function is free of bugs. Code coverage as a metric isn’t able to measure all possible code paths and states—different flags and configurations may trigger different behaviors, unearthing different bugs. These examples underscore the need to continue to generate new varieties of fuzz targets even for code that is already fuzzed, as has also been shown by Project Zero in the past (1, 2).New improvementsTo achieve these results, we’ve been focusing on two major improvements:Automatically generate more relevant context in our prompts. The more complete and relevant information we can provide the LLM about a project, the less likely it would be to hallucinate the missing details in its response. This meant providing more accurate, project-specific context in prompts, such as function, type definitions, cross references, and existing unit tests for each project. To generate this information automatically, we built new infrastructure to index projects across OSS-Fuzz. LLMs turned out to be highly effective at emulating a typical developer’s entire workflow of writing, testing, and iterating on the fuzz target, as well as triaging the crashes found. Thanks to this, it was possible to further automate more parts of the fuzzing workflow. This additional iterative feedback in turn also resulted in higher quality and greater number of correct fuzz targets. The workflow in actionOur LLM can now execute the first four steps of the developer’s process (with the fifth soon to come). 1. Drafting an initial fuzz targetA developer might check the source code, existing documentation and unit tests, as well as  usages of the target function when to draft an initial fuzz target. An LLM can fulfill this role here, if we provide a prompt with this information and ask it to come up with a fuzz target. Prompt: Your goal is to write a fuzzing harness for the provided function-under-test signature using LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput. It is important that the provided solution compiles and actually calls the function-under-test specified by the function signature:unsigned char * buffer_append_base64_decode(buffer *, const char *, size_t, base64_charset)Here is the source code of the function being tested:unsigned char* buffer_append_base64_decode(buffer *out, const char* in, size_t in_length, base64_charset charset) {    const size_t reserve = 3*(in_length/4) + 3;    unsigned char * const result = (unsigned char *)      buffer_string_prepare_append(out, reserve);    const size_t out_pos =      li_base64_dec(result, reserve, in, in_length, charset);    buffer_commit(out, out_pos);    return (out_pos || !in_length) ? result : NULL;}Here is the source code for functions which reference the function being tested:…  2. Fixing any compilation issues that arise. Once a developer has a candidate target, they would try to compile it and look at any compilation issues that arise. Again, we can prompt an LLM with details of the compilation errors so it can provide fixes.  Prompt: Below is the error to fix:The code has the following build issues:server_fuzzer.cc:12:46: error: only virtual member functions can be marked 'override'   12 |   bool OnData(const char* data, size_t size) override {      |                                              ^~~~~~~~server_fuzzer.cc:22:39: error: no type named 'MultiPartFile' in namespace 'httplib'   22 |                        const httplib::MultiPartFile& file) override {      |                              ~~~~~~~~~^server_fuzzer.cc:12:27: warning: unused parameter 'data' [-Wunused-parameter]   12 |   bool OnData(const char* data, size_t size) override {      |                           ^server_fuzzer.cc:37:5: error: use of undeclared 'operator()'   37 |     operator()(request_data.data(), receiver);      |     ^server_fuzzer.cc:27:23: warning: private field 'provider_' is not used [-Wunused-private-field]   27 |   FuzzedDataProvider& provider_;      |                       ^Example of compilation errors that an LLM was able to fix3. Running the fuzz target to see how it performs, and fixing any obvious mistakes causing runtime issues.Once all compilation errors are fixed, a developer would try running the fuzz target for a short period of time to see if there were any mistakes that led it to instantly crash, suggesting an error with the target rather than a bug discovered in the project.The following is an example of an LLM fixing a semantic issue with the fuzzing setup: LLM Response:The issue is that `sqlite3_blob_open` requires the table to exist before you can open a blob on it. The fix ensures that the table exists by executing a `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statement before calling `sqlite3_blob_open`. Here's a breakdown of the changes:1. **Create Table Query:** A string `createTableQuery` is constructed to hold the SQL statement for creating the table. It uses the fuzzed values for the table and column names.2. **Prepare Statement:** `sqlite3_prepare_v2` is used to prepare the SQL statement from `createTableQuery`. This compiles the SQL into a byte-code program that SQLite can execute.3. **Execute Statement:** `sqlite3_step` executes the prepared statement. Since it's a `CREATE TABLE` statement, it doesn't return any data, but it creates the table if it doesn't exist.4. **Finalize Statement:** `sqlite3_finalize` destroys the prepared statement object when it's no longer needed.By adding these steps before calling `sqlite3_blob_open`, we ensure that the table exists, preventing the null pointer access issue. 4. Running the corrected fuzz target for a longer period of time, and triaging any crashes.At this point, the fuzz target is ready to run for an extended period of time on a suitable fuzzing infrastructure, such as ClusterFuzz. Any discovered crashes would then need to be triaged, to determine the root causes and whether they represented legitimate vulnerabilities (or bugs in the fuzz target). An LLM can be prompted with the relevant context (stacktraces, fuzz target source code, relevant project source code) to perform this triage. Prompt: Given the following crash report, fuzz driver code and relevant project function code, analyze the cause of the crash.First, only answer “Crash is caused by bug in fuzz driver” or “Crash is caused by bug in project”. Second, offer a succinct and to-the-point analysis.Below is crash report:AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free on address 0x502000000630 at pc 0x560036939242 bp 0x7ffd65dca850 sp 0x7ffd65dca010READ of size 1 at 0x502000000630 thread T0SCARINESS: 40 (1-byte-read-heap-use-after-free)    #0 0x560036939241 in __asan_memcpy /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_interceptors_memintrinsics.cpp:63:3    #1 0x56003697d30b in EmitLiteral /src/snappy/snappy.cc:661:5    #2 0x56003697d30b in snappy::internal::CompressFragment(char const*, unsigned long, char*, unsigned short*, int) /src/snappy/snappy.cc:954:10In this example, the LLM correctly determines this is a bug in the fuzz target, rather than a bug in the project being fuzzed. LLM Response: Crash is caused by bug in fuzz driver.The fuzz driver creates a vector of `iovec` structures, each pointing to a chunk of memory owned by the `FuzzedDataProvider`. However, the `data_chunk` vector, which holds the actual data pointed to by `iov_base`, is deallocated at the end of each fuzzer iteration when it goes out of scope. This leaves the `iov_base` pointers dangling. When `snappy::CompressFromIOVec` tries to access the memory pointed to by these dangling pointers, a heap-use-after-free occurs. 5. Fixing vulnerabilities. The goal is to fully automate this entire workflow by having the LLM generate a suggested patch for the vulnerability. We don’t have anything we can share here today, but we’re collaborating with various researchers to make this a reality and look forward to sharing results soon. Up nextImproving automated triaging: to get to a point where we’re confident about not requiring human review. This will help automatically report new vulnerabilities to project maintainers. There are likely more than the 26 vulnerabilities we’ve already reported upstream hiding in our results.Agent-based architecture: which means letting the LLM autonomously plan out the steps to solve a particular problem by providing it with access to tools that enable it to get more information, as well as to check and validate results. By providing LLM with interactive access to real tools such as debuggers, we’ve found that the LLM is more likely to arrive at a correct result.Integrating our research into OSS-Fuzz as a feature: to achieve a more fully automated end-to-end solution for vulnerability discovery and patching. We hope OSS-Fuzz will be useful for other researchers to evaluate AI-powered vulnerability discovery ideas and ultimately become a tool that will enable defenders to find more vulnerabilities before they get exploited. For more information, check out our open source framework at oss-fuzz-gen. We’re hoping to continue to collaborate on this area with other researchers. Also, be sure to check out the OSS-Fuzz blog for more technical updates.",

      "link": "http://security.googleblog.com/2024/11/retrofitting-spatial-safety-to-hundreds.html",
      "contentSnippet": "Posted by Alex Rebert and Max Shavrick, Security Foundations, and Kinuko Yasuda, Core Developer\n\n\n\n\nAttackers regularly exploit spatial memory safety vulnerabilities, which occur when code accesses a memory allocation outside of its intended bounds, to compromise systems and sensitive data. These vulnerabilities represent a major security risk to users. \n\n\n\nBased on an analysis of in-the-wild exploits tracked by Google's Project Zero, spatial safety vulnerabilities represent 40% of in-the-wild memory safety exploits over the past decade:\n\n\n\n\nBreakdown of memory safety CVEs exploited in the wild by vulnerability class.1\n\nGoogle is taking a comprehensive approach to memory safety. A key element of our strategy focuses on Safe Coding and using memory-safe languages in new code. This leads to an exponential decline in memory safety vulnerabilities and quickly improves the overall security posture of a codebase, as demonstrated by our post about Android's journey to memory safety.\n\n\nHowever, this transition will take multiple years as we adapt our development practices and infrastructure. Ensuring the safety of our billions of users therefore requires us to go further: we're also retrofitting secure-by-design principles to our existing C++ codebase wherever possible.\n\nTo that end, we're working towards bringing spatial memory safety into as many of our C++ codebases as possible, including Chrome and the monolithic codebase powering our services.\n\nWe’ve begun by enabling hardened libc++, which adds bounds checking to standard C++ data structures, eliminating a significant class of spatial safety bugs. While C++ will not become fully memory-safe, these improvements reduce risk as discussed in more detail in our perspective on memory safety, leading to more reliable and secure software.\n\nThis post explains how we're retrofitting hardened libc++ across our codebases and  showcases the positive impact it's already having, including preventing exploits, reducing crashes, and improving code correctness.\n\nBounds-checked data structures: The foundation for spatial safety\n\nOne of our primary strategies for improving spatial safety in C++ is to implement bounds checking for common data structures, starting with hardening the C++ standard library (in our case, LLVM’s libc++). Hardened libc++, recently added by open source contributors, introduces a set of security checks designed to catch vulnerabilities such as out-of-bounds accesses in production.\n\nFor example, hardened libc++ ensures that every access to an element of a std::vector stays within its allocated bounds, preventing attempts to read or write beyond the valid memory region. Similarly, hardened libc++ checks that a std::optional isn't empty before allowing access, preventing access to uninitialized memory.\n\nThis approach mirrors what's already standard practice in many modern programming languages like Java, Python, Go, and Rust. They all incorporate bounds checking by default, recognizing its crucial role in preventing memory errors. C++ has been a notable exception, but efforts like hardened libc++ aim to close this gap in our infrastructure. It’s also worth noting that similar hardening is available in other C++ standard libraries, such as libstdc++.\n\nRaising the security baseline across the board\n\nBuilding on the successful deployment of hardened libc++ in Chrome in 2022, we've now made it default across our server-side production systems. This improves spatial memory safety across our services, including key performance-critical components of products like Search, Gmail, Drive, YouTube, and Maps. While a very small number of components remain opted out, we're actively working to reduce this and raise the bar for security across the board, even in applications with lower exploitation risk.\n\nThe performance impact of these changes was surprisingly low, despite Google's modern C++ codebase making heavy use of libc++. Hardening libc++ resulted in an average 0.30% performance impact across our services (yes, only a third of a percent).\n \nThis is due to both the compiler's ability to eliminate redundant checks during optimization, and the efficient design of hardened libc++. While a handful of performance-critical code paths still require targeted use of explicitly unsafe accesses, these instances are carefully reviewed for safety. Techniques like profile-guided optimizations further improved performance, but even without those advanced techniques, the overhead of bounds checking remains minimal.\n \nWe actively monitor the performance impact of these checks and work to minimize any unnecessary overhead. For instance, we identified and fixed an unnecessary check, which led to a 15% reduction in overhead (reduced from 0.35% to 0.3%), and contributed the fix back to the LLVM project to share the benefits with the broader C++ community. \n\nWhile hardened libc++'s overhead is minimal for individual applications in most cases, deploying it at Google's scale required a substantial commitment of computing resources. This investment underscores our dedication to enhancing the safety and security of our products.\n \n From tests to production\n \nEnabling libc++ hardening wasn't a simple flip of a switch. Rather, it required a multi-stage rollout to avoid accidentally disrupting users or creating an outage:\n\n Testing: We first enabled hardened libc++ in our tests over a year ago. This allowed us to identify and fix hundreds of previously undetected bugs in our code and tests.\n Baking: We let the hardened runtime \"bake\" in our testing and pre-production environments, giving developers time to adapt and address any new issues that surfaced. We also conducted extensive performance evaluations, ensuring minimal impact to our users' experience.\n Gradual Production Rollout: We then rolled out hardened libc++ to production over several months, starting with a small set of services and gradually expanding to our entire infrastructure. We closely monitored the rollout, promptly addressing any crashes or performance regressions.\n \n \n Quantifiable impact\n \n In just a few months since enabling hardened libc++ by default, we've already seen benefits.\n\n Preventing exploits: Hardened libc++ has already disrupted an internal red team exercise and would have prevented another one that happened before we enabled hardening, demonstrating its effectiveness in thwarting exploits. The safety checks have uncovered over 1,000 bugs, and would prevent 1,000 to 2,000 new bugs yearly at our current rate of C++ development.\n\n Improved reliability and correctness: The process of identifying and fixing bugs uncovered by hardened libc++ led to a 30% reduction in our baseline segmentation fault rate across production, indicating improved code reliability and quality. Beyond crashes, the checks also caught errors that would have otherwise manifested as unpredictable behavior or data corruption.\n\n \n \n Moving average of segfaults across our fleet over time, before and after enablement.\n \n\n Easier debugging: Hardened libc++ enabled us to identify and fix multiple bugs that had been lurking in our code for more than a decade. The checks transform many difficult-to-diagnose memory corruptions into immediate and easily debuggable errors, saving developers valuable time and effort. \n \n Bridging the gap with memory-safe languages\n\nWhile libc++ hardening provides immediate benefits by adding bounds checking to standard data structures, it's only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to spatial safety.\n\nWe're expanding bounds checking to other libraries and working to migrate our code to Safe Buffers, requiring all accesses to be bounds checked. For spatial safety, both hardened data structures, including their iterators, and Safe Buffers are necessary.\n\nBeyond improving the safety of our C++, we're also focused on making it easier to interoperate with memory-safe languages. Migrating our C++ to Safe Buffers shrinks the gap between the languages, which simplifies interoperability and potentially even an eventual automated translation.\n\n Building a safer C++ ecosystem\n\nHardened libc++ is a practical and effective way to enhance the safety, reliability, and debuggability of C++ code with minimal overhead. Given this, we strongly encourage organizations using C++ to enable their standard library's hardened mode universally by default.\n\nAt Google, enabling hardened libc++ is only the first step in our journey towards a spatially safe C++ codebase. By expanding bounds checking, migrating to Safe Buffers, and actively collaborating with the broader C++ community, we aim to create a future where spatial safety is the norm.\n\n Acknowledgements\n\nWe’d like to thank Emilia Kasper, Chandler Carruth, Duygu Isler, Matthew Riley, and Jeff Vander Stoep for their helpful feedback. We also extend our thanks to the libc++ community for developing the hardening mode that made this work possible.",
