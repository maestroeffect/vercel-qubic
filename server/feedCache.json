      "contentSnippet": "Apple could be developing a new app that's designed to help users organize meetings and in-person events, if code discovered in the latest iOS 18.3 beta is anything to go by. \r\n\r\n\r\nReferences in iOS 18.3 beta 2 spotted by 9to5Mac suggest the app is called \"Invites,\" and it will show users a list of people invited to an event and indicate those who have confirmed their attendance. The code also suggests that the app will integrate with iCloud, with a web version on iCloud.com also a possibility.\r\n\r\nThe app apparently taps into Apple's previously unused GroupKit daemon, which handles database models for groups of people. Little else is known about the app – it could be standalone, or it could be an integration with existing apps. Whatever it is, the Invites app sounds like it will offer more event-related features than those found in Calendar, which currently manages event invites through a rather simplistic interface.\r\n\r\nThe beta code references reportedly first appeared in one of the iOS 18.2 betas, before being removed from the final release. Now they're back in iOS 18.3 beta 2, but that doesn't guarantee that Apple will release the app. The company could just be experimenting with an idea that is ultimately nixed from iOS 18.3, or Apple could decide to hold it over for a succeeding software update. \r\n\r\nApple seeded the second betas of iOS 18.3 and iPadOS 18.3 to developers on Tuesday for testing purposes. There are no new Apple Intelligence features in the updates, which will likely focus primarily on bugs and small software refinements. Additional Apple Intelligence functionality is coming in later iOS 18.4 and iPadOS 18.4 updates.This article, \"Apple Seemingly Working on New 'Invites' App to Manage Events\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "link": "https://dev.to/devmercy/spring-data-jpa-speed-up-development-business-focus-1ob9",
      "contentSnippet": "Spring Data JPA allows you to build scalable backend applications backed by any relational database. It is a great choice allowing you to speed up your development and and focus on the business logic.\n\nIn this article, you are going to learn the following:\n\n\nWhat is Spring Data JPA\nConnect to real database not in the memory DB\nHow to map classes to tables\nHibernate entity life cycle\nQueries\nPaging and sorting\n1 to 1 relationships\n1 to many relationships\nMany to many relationships\nTransactions\n\n\n\n\nHere in this article you will learn how to this Application Database Design using Spring Data JPA.\n\nWhat is Spring Data JPA\nSpring Data JPA is a framework that abstracts all of the complexity needed for you to interact with your databases.\n\nJPA (Java Persistent API) is the sun specification for persisting objects in the enterprise application. It is currently used as the replacement for complex entity beans. It is a specification for accessing persisting and managing data between java objects.\n\nHibernate is one implementation of the Spring Data JPA interface. It tackles any java object.\n\nSpring Data JPA gives a lot of queries and we can access our database without having to write any single line of SQL and that happens through repositories. It makes the relationship between Spring Data JPA and Spring Boot much easier without having to configure a lot of things.\n\nFor this tutorial, I’m gonna be using IntellijIDEA. There are two versions, the community one which is free and the ultimate edition. For this I am using the ultimate edition since I am going to do lots of database work, it gives us the database functionality right within IntelliJ. By so doing, we can see the tables, indexes, and can perform queries.\n\nBehold that the ultimate edition is not free but it has a free trial for a month. If you don’t have intelliJ download it here.\n\nYou can start your app from the cloned repository or start from scratch. This article assumes you already know how to clone or start a Spring Boot application. Configuration is the most important part so I’m gonna show you how to do it here.\n\nTo start the application open the application properties and add the following configurations:\n\n\n\nspring.application.name=demo\nspring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://localhost:5432/mercy\nspring.datasource.username=\nspring.datasource.password=\nspring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop\nspring.jpa.show-sql=true\nspring.jpa.properties.hibernate.dialect=org.hibernate.dialect.PostgresSQLDialect\nspring.jpa.properties.hibernate.format_sql=true\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDemo is the name of the application.\n\nFollowing the connection URL for our database username and password. I am using Mac so I don’t have to specify the username and password but if you are on Windows you have to specify.\n\nThe create-drop means create a schema and before the app shuts down drop everything. Set show-sql to true so that you can see the SQL statements that Hibernate will be generated. Specify the dialect and also configure it SQL to be formatted.\n\nYou can use commands to create databases like CREATE DATABASE anesu;  this will create a new database called anesu if successful, you will see CREATE DATABASE After creating the database, you can connect to it using: c anesu\n\nYou can also connect to the database inside the IntellijIDEA, by clicking the database icon on the top right corner, click the pus button, hover the data source and it will display data sources you can use to connect to your database. Choose the one of your choice but on this article, we will be using PostgreSQL.\n\n\n \n \n Set up the pom.xml\n\n\nThen open pom.xml and add these dependencies:\n\n\n\n\n  org.springframework.boot\n  spring-boot-starter-data-jpa\n\n\n\n  org.springframework.boot\n  spring-boot-starter-web\n\n\n\n  org.postgresql\n  postgresql\n  runtime\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Define Data Model\n\n\n\n\n\npackage com.bezkoder.spring.jpa.postgresql.model;\n\n// import javax.persistence.*; // for Spring Boot 2\nimport jakarta.persistence.*; // for Spring Boot 3\n\n@Entity\n@Table(name = \"tutorials\")\npublic class Tutorial {\n\n  @Id\n  @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.AUTO)\n  private long id;\n\n  @Column(name = \"title\")\n  private String title;\n\n  @Column(name = \"description\")\n  private String description;\n\n  @Column(name = \"published\")\n  private boolean published;\n\n  public Tutorial() {\n\n  }\n\n  public Tutorial(String title, String description, boolean published) {\n    this.title = title;\n    this.description = description;\n    this.published = published;\n  }\n\n  public long getId() {\n    return id;\n  }\n\n  public String getTitle() {\n    return title;\n  }\n\n  public void setTitle(String title) {\n    this.title = title;\n  }\n\n  public String getDescription() {\n    return description;\n  }\n\n  public void setDescription(String description) {\n    this.description = description;\n  }\n\n  public boolean isPublished() {\n    return published;\n  }\n\n  public void setPublished(boolean isPublished) {\n    this.published = isPublished;\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  public String toString() {\n    return \"Tutorial [id=\" + id + \", title=\" + title + \", desc=\" + description + \", published=\" + published + \"]\";\n  }\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n@Entityannotation indicates that the class is a persistent Java class.\n@Tableannotation provides the table that maps this entity.\n@Idannotation is for the primary key.\n@GeneratedValue annotation is used to define the generation strategy for the primary key. GenerationType.AUTOmeans Auto Increment field.\n\n@column annotation is used to define the column in the database that maps the annotated field.\n\n\nCreate Repository Interface\n\nLet’s create a repository to interact with Tutorials from the database. In repository package, create TutorialRepository interface that extends JpaRepository.\n\nrepository/TutorialRepository.java\n\n\n\npackage com.bezkoder.spring.jpa.postgresql.repository;\n\nimport java.util.List;\n\nimport org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;\n\nimport com.bezkoder.spring.jpa.postgresql.model.Tutorial;\n\npublic interface TutorialRepository extends JpaRepository {\n List findByPublished(boolean published);\n\n List findByTitleContaining(String title);\n}\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNow we can use JpaRepository’s methods: save(), findOne(), findById(), findAll(), count(), delete(), deleteById()… without implementing these methods.\nWe also define custom finder methods:\n\n–findByPublished(): returns all Tutorials with published having value as input published.–findByTitleContaining(): returns all Tutorials which title contains input title.\n\nThe implementation is plugged in by Spring Data JPA automatically.\n\nMore Derived queries at:JPA Repository query example in Spring Boot\n\nCustom query with @Queryannotation:Spring JPA @Query example: Custom query in Spring Boot\n\nYou can modify this Repository:\n\n\nto work with Pagination, the instruction can be found at:Spring Boot Pagination & Filter example | Spring JPA, Pageable\nor to sort/order by multiple fields with the tutorial:Spring Data JPA Sort/Order by multiple Columns | Spring Boot\n\n\nYou also find way to write Unit Test for this JPA Repository at:Spring Boot Unit Test for JPA Repository with @DataJpaTest\n\nOr: Spring Boot Unit Test for Rest Controller\n\nUnfortunately for this, I am not going to give out all code files considering this post is for people who know how to use Spring Boot.\n\n*Create Spring Rest APIs Controller\n*\nFinally, we create a controller that provides APIs for creating, retrieving, updating, deleting, and finding Tutorials.\n\nHere is what is in the database\n\n\n\nRead more here",

      "link": "https://dev.to/brunoredes/migrando-de-callbacks-para-argument-observable-no-rxjs-3f4n",
      "contentSnippet": "Você, pessoa que usa rxjs no seu dia a dia, já deve ter reparado que desde a versão 6.4. o RxJS colocou uma anotação de deprecated no método subscribe:\n\n\n@deprecated — Instead of passing separate callback arguments, use an observer argument. Signatures taking separate callback arguments will be removed in v8. Details: https://rxjs.dev/deprecations/subscribe-arguments\n\n\nA justificativa é que usar callbacks separadas gera uma pior leitura do método, e então é preferível usar argumentos subscribe fazendo a desestruturação das propriedades que o método retorna.\n\nPara entendermos melhor como isso fica na prática, vamos a um exemplo rápido:\n\ndata.js\n\n\n\nimport { Observable } from \"rxjs\";\n\n/**\n * Cria um observable que emite valores numéricos de 1 até 5, e então se finaliza.\n *\n * @returns {Observable} Um observable que emite números de 1 até 5 em sequência.\n */\nexport const data = () = > {\n return new Observable((observer) = > {\n  for (let i = 1; i {\n return new Observable((observer) = > {\n  observer.error(\"Aconteceu um erro!\");\n });\n};\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEste será o nosso arquivo base. O primeiro método emite números de 1 até 5 em sequência com o método .next();, e assim que o loop é finalizado, o observable é completado com o método .complete();.\n\nO segundo método cria um observable que emite um erro imediatamente\n\n\nPS: quando o método .error() é chamado, o observable para de emitir valores e não pode continuar emitindo valores via .next() ou ser completado com o .complete().\n\n\nE vamos ao que interessa.\n\nIremos usar como primeiro exemplo a maneira que atualmente está depreciada, e logo em seguida, irei mostrar como utilizarmos o argument observable.\n\n\n\nimport { data, dataWithError } from \"./data.js\";\n\ndata().subscribe(\n (value) = > console.log(value),\n (error) = > {},\n () = > {\n  console.log(\"completou\");\n }\n);\n\ndataWithError().subscribe(\n () = > {},\n (error) = > {\n  console.error({ error });\n }\n);\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPerceba que por ser um exemplo é algo mais visível, mas que ao mesmo tempo, precisamos saber qual a ordem de cada callback (next, error e complete).\n\nDito isso, vamos ao como usar os argument observables:\n\n\n\nimport { data, dataWithError } from \"./data.js\";\n\ndata().subscribe({\n next: (data) = > console.log(data),\n complete: () = > console.log(\"completou\"),\n});\n\ndataWithError()\n  .subscribe({ error: (error) = > console.error({ error })\n  });\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA partir deste ponto com os argument observables, temos uma leitura mais limpa do que estamos usando dentro do método subscribe, não precisando declarar callbacks ou argumentos que não utilizaremos.\n\nÉ uma migração fácil de ser realizada, e deixará seu código sem mensagens de depreciação dessa API.",

Every millisecond counts in this modern testing landscape.\n\nWith this in mind, I experimented to compare the test execution speed of two of today’s most popular modern test automation frameworks: Cypress and Playwright.\n\nIf you're not already familiar with these frameworks, here's a brief introduction to each:\n\nCypress is a front-end testing tool designed for modern web applications. Initially built for end-to-end testing, it has since expanded its capabilities to include component testing, accessibility testing, and more. Cypress supports test scripting in JavaScript and TypeScript and offers compatibility with Chromium-based browsers, Firefox, and WebKit (experimental). It operates directly in the browser, providing a seamless developer experience with features like built-in debugging, automatic waiting, and real-time reloading.\n\nPlaywright is an end-to-end testing framework for modern web applications that supports multiple programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, C#, and Java. It fully supports all major browser engines—Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox—making it an excellent choice for cross-browser testing. With powerful features like multiple browser context handling, parallel execution, and robust language integrations, Playwright is ideal for scalable and efficient test automation in diverse environments.\n\nFor this project, I wrote end-to-end tests in a TDD style using both frameworks for the Swaglabs V1 demo website. You can find the test scripts in my GitHub repository here.\n\nI created three test files for each framework, covering the following functionalities:\n\n\nLogging in\nAdding items to the cart\nChecking out\n\n\nTo ensure a fair comparison, I used the same selectors and functions across both frameworks as much as possible. This approach helps maintain consistency and minimizes discrepancies in the results.\n\n\n \n \n File structure\n\n\nFor this project, I created a root directory named swaglabs-tests, which contains two sub-folders: cypress-tests and playwright-tests.\n\nFile structure for cypress-tests\n\n\n\ncypress-tests\n ┣ cypress\n ┃ ┣ downloads\n ┃ ┣ e2e\n ┃ ┃ ┣ addToCart.cy.js\n ┃ ┃ ┣ checkout.cy.js\n ┃ ┃ ┗ login.cy.js\n ┃ ┗ support\n ┃ ┃ ┣ commands.js\n ┃ ┃ ┣ e2e.js\n ┃ ┃ ┗ helpers.js\n ┣ README\n ┣ cypress.config.js\n ┣ package-lock.json\n ┗ package.json\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFile structure for playwright-tests\n\n\n\nplaywright-tests\n ┣ helpers\n ┃ ┗ helpers.js\n ┣ playwright-report\n ┃ ┗ index.html\n ┣ test-results\n ┃ ┗ .last-run.json\n ┣ tests\n ┃ ┣ addToCart.spec.js\n ┃ ┣ checkout.spec.js\n ┃ ┗ login.spec.js\n ┣ package-lock.json\n ┣ package.json\n ┗ playwright.config.js\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Test execution\n\n\nEach framework contains 3 test suites with a total of 9 tests:\n\n\nLogin Suite: 5 tests\nAdd to Cart Suite: 2 tests\nCheckout Suite: 2 tests\n\n\n\n \n \n In Local Machine\n\n\nThe tests were executed in both headless and headed modes using the Chrome browser.\n\nCypress Execution in Headless Mode\n\n\n\n(Run Finished)\n\n\n    Spec                       Tests Passing Failing Pending Skipped\n ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n │ ✔ addToCart.cy.js             00:09    2    2    -    -    - │\n ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n │ ✔ checkout.cy.js              00:10    2    2    -    -    - │\n ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n │ ✔ login.cy.js               00:06    5    5    -    -    - │\n └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n  ✔ All specs passed!            00:26    9    9    -    -    -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCypress executed the tests in 26 seconds, with repeated runs showing execution times ranging from 21 seconds to 26 seconds, averaging 24 seconds.\n\nPlaywright Execution in Headless Mode\n\nBy default, Playwright runs tests in parallel across multiple workers. To ensure a fair comparison with Cypress, I configured Playwright to run tests sequentially with a single worker by updating the playwright.config.js file:\n\n\n\n//playwright.config.js\n\nexport default defineConfig({}\n  .....\n\n  fullyParallel: false, // Disable parallel execution\n  workers: 1, // Use a single worker\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRunning 9 tests using 1 worker\n\n ✓ 1 [chromium] › addToCart.spec.js:9:6 › Add to cart › user adds a item to cart (3.9s)\n ✓ 2 [chromium] › addToCart.spec.js:13:6 › Add to cart › user adds multiple items to cart (1.9s)\n ✓ 3 [chromium] › checkout.spec.js:9:6 › checkout › user checks-out a item from the cart (2.2s)\n ✓ 4 [chromium] › checkout.spec.js:14:6 › checkout › user checks-out multiple items from the cart (2.1s)\n ✓ 5 [chromium] › login.spec.js:9:6 › Login › normal user logs in (1.5s)\n ✓ 6 [chromium] › login.spec.js:18:6 › Login › locked out user logs in (435ms)\n ✓ 7 [chromium] › login.spec.js:28:6 › Login › user logs in with no password (443ms)\n ✓ 8 [chromium] › login.spec.js:37:6 › Login › user submits empty form (394ms)\n ✓ 9 [chromium] › login.spec.js:45:6 › Login › user logs in with incorrect password (423ms)\n\n 9 passed (13.8s)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaywright completed the execution in around 14 seconds, with repeated runs ranging from 13 seconds to 15 seconds, averaging at 14 seconds.

Both frameworks were configured to run tests using the Chrome browser. The workflow files can be found here.

Here is how each framework performed:\n\n\n \n \n Cypress Cross-Browser Test Execution\n\n\nCypress does not natively support running tests across multiple browsers in a single command, requiring separate executions for each browser. This means tests had to be run individually for Chrome and Firefox.\n\nAdditionally, Cypress uses Playwright's WebKit engine for WebKit testing, which is still in the experimental stage. When attempting to execute tests in WebKit, I encountered an error that I was unable to resolve, so results for WebKit are unavailable.\n\nChrome headless\n\n\n\n\n (Run Finished)\n\n\n    Spec                       Tests Passing Failing Pending Skipped\n ┌────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐\n │ ✔ addToCart.cy.js             00:06    2    2    -    -    - │\n ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n │ ✔ checkout.cy.js              00:09    2    2    -    -    - │\n ├────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤\n │ ✔ login.cy.js               00:05    5    5    -    -    - │\n └────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘\n  ✔ All specs passed!            00:21    9    9    -    -    -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe total test execution time in Chrome ranged between 19-22 seconds, with an average execution time of 21 seconds.

to additional setup steps, taking around 41 seconds for both browsers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPlaywright:\n\n\nTest execution times in Chrome and Firefox were less than that of Cypress(43s for combined).\nThe Playwright test pipeline was faster than Cypress, taking only 25 seconds in total.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCI Efficiency:\n\n\nPlaywright tests are more efficient in terms of total CI execution time compared to Cypress, with Playwright completing in 45 seconds versus Cypress taking 1m 45s.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Overall summary table\n\n\n\n\n\nFramework\nEnvironment\nBrowser(s)\nMode\nTest Execution

outperformed Cypress in test execution time across environments.\nIn local environments, Playwright completed tests in nearly half the time compared to Cypress in headless mode.\nIn CI, Playwright's combined browser execution (24s) was significantly faster than Cypress's separate executions (16s + 17s).\n\n\n\n\nPipeline Efficiency:\n\n\n\nCypress pipelines consumed more time for setup and execution, taking 41 seconds for both Chrome and Firefox individually in CI.\nPlaywright pipelines were optimized for multi-browser execution, completing setup and execution in just 25 seconds.\n\n\n\n\nConcurrency:\n\n\n\nPlaywright supports native multi-browser execution, running tests concurrently across browsers with a single command.\nCypress lacks this capability, requiring separate commands for each browser, resulting in increased overall execution time.\n\n\n\n\nConsistency:\n\n\nCypress showed consistent test execution times across Chrome and Firefox in both local and CI environments.\nPlaywright maintained fast and reliable execution with minimal time variability in both environments.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n Conclusion\n\n\nBoth Cypress and Playwright are reliable testing frameworks for modern automation needs. However, Playwright stands out in terms of speed, efficiency, and multi-browser support. Its ability to run tests concurrently across multiple browsers and its optimized CI pipeline make it a better choice for teams looking to save time and resources. Cypress, while user-friendly and consistent, may not be the best fit for large-scale projects requiring extensive cross-browser testing or time-sensitive CI/CD workflows.",

      "link": "https://dev.to/dminatto/distributed-monolith-why-are-you-destroying-my-life-5hj5",
      "contentSnippet": "In a quick search, you'll find numerous posts about why to develop in microservices. In recent years, this has become one of the hypes among developers, and I'm no exception. The first time I heard about this architecture type, it promised to open up an incredible range of possibilities.\n\n\n \n \n The Theory\n\n\nMicroservices architecture was initially designed to solve scalability and maintainability problems, being used instead of the traditional monolith because it allows the system to continue operating normally even if one of its modules fails. When this service returns, it can \"catch up\" with lost time, not generating inconsistencies in the system's database.\n\n\n \n \n The Reality\n\n\nThis was the essence, and the theory is beautiful, but what began to happen was the misuse and abuse of this technique. Everyone wanted to develop in microservices and claim they were developing in microservices, but in most cases, this was created:\n\n\nYes, this is a real case (unfortunately)\n\nIn this case, we can see that the modules have a strong coupling between them, which would already mischaracterize them as a microservice. The communication occurs through traditional requests, and here's where the nightmare begins:\n\n\nNo visibility into service failures\nInconsistent database states when services fail\nSystem-wide failures from single-point failures\n\n\n\n \n \n What is a Distributed Monolith?\n\n\nIf you've encountered a scenario like this, congratulations, you've experienced a distributed monolith firsthand. A distributed monolith is a system broken into multiple parts with a high level of dependency and coupling. It can originate from a traditional monolith or a new system feature.\n\n\n \n \n The Solution\n\n\nThe solution starts with asking the right questions:\n\n\nDo we really need these services to be decoupled?\nWhat is the actual scope of each service?\nWhat are the real dependencies between services?\n\n\nLet's look at a better approach:\n\n\nImproved architecture with proper service boundaries\n\n\n \n \n Key Improvements\n\n\n\n\nProper Service Boundaries: A collection service should handle all collections, not just specific types.\n\nReduced Coupling: Services should be able to operate independently where possible.\n\nClear Responsibilities: Each service should have a single, well-defined purpose.\n\n\n\n\n\nWhen implementing microservices, it's crucial to:\n\n\nCarefully consider service boundaries\nMaintain loose coupling between services\nEnsure each service can operate independently\nHave proper error handling and fallback mechanisms\n\n\nRemember, not everything needs to be a microservice. Sometimes, a well-structured monolith is better than a poorly designed distributed system.",

Forscher von Chainxin X Lab stellten fest, dass Cyberkriminelle das Botnet seit November 2024 nutzen, um bislang unbekannte Schwachstellen anzugreifen. Zu den bevorzugten Zielen des Botnetzes gehören Router der Marken Four-Faith und Neterbit oder Smart-Home-Geräte.\n\n\n\nIn diesem Zusammenhang berichteten Experten von VulnCheck Ende Dezember vor einer Schwachstelle bei Industrieroutern von Four-Faith (CVE-2024-12856), die in freier Wildbahn ausgenutzt wurde. Die Angreifer nutzten demnach die Standardanmeldeinformationen des Routers aus, um eine Remote Command Injection zu starten.\n\n\n\nDarüber hinaus wurde das Botnet für gezielte Angriffe auf unbekannte Schwachstellen in Neterbit-Routern und Smart-Home-Geräten von Vimar verwendet. Nach Angaben von Chainxin X Lab wird Gayfemboy für insgesamt 20 Schwachstellen und schwache Telnet-Passwörter eingesetzt. Es verfügt über ein Brute-Force-Modul für unsichere Telnet-Passwörter, verwendet benutzerdefiniertes UPX-Packing mit eindeutigen Signaturen und implementiert Mirai-basierte Befehlsstrukturen. Dadurch seien die Angreifer in der Lage, Clients zu aktualisieren, Netzwerke zu scannen und DDoS-Attacken durchzuführen.\n\n\n\nAngriffsziele\n\n\n\nDen Forschern zufolge werden über das Botnet seit seiner Entdeckung im Februar 2024 täglich Hunderte von Zielen angegriffen. Die Zahl der täglich aktiven Bot-IPs liegt demnach bei 15.000, die meisten davon befinden sich in China, den USA, Russland, der Türkei und dem Iran. Die Angriffsziele sind auf der ganzen Welt verteilt und betreffen verschiedenen Branchen. Die Hauptangriffsziele befinden sich in China, den Vereinigten Staaten, Deutschland, dem Vereinigten Königreich und Singapur.\n\n\n\nLaut Chainxin X Lab sind die DDoS-Angriffe des Botnet zwar von kurzer Dauer (zwischen 10 und 30 Sekunden), weisen jedoch eine hohe Intensität auf, wobei die Datenrate 100 Gbit/s übersteigt und selbst bei robusten Infrastrukturen zu Störungen führen kann.\n\n\n\nGefährdete Geräte\n\n\n\nDer Analyse zufolge zielen die Angriffe des Botnet auf folgende Geräte ab:\n\n\n\n\nASUS-Router (über N-Day-Exploits).\n\n\n\nHuawei-Router (über CVE-2017-17215)\n\n\n\nNeterbit-Router (benutzerdefinierter Exploit)\n\n\n\nLB-Link-Router (über CVE-2023-26801)\n\n\n\nFour-Faith Industrial Routers (über den Zero-Day, der jetzt als CVE-2024-12856 verfolgt wird)\n\n\n\nPZT-Kameras (über  CVE-2024-8956 und CVE-2024-8957 )\n\n\n\nKguard DVR\n\n\n\nLilin DVR (über Exploits zur Remote-Code-Ausführung)\n\n\n\nGenerische DVRs (unter Verwendung von Exploits wie TVT editBlackAndWhiteList RCE)\n\n\n\nVimar-Smart-Home-Geräte (vermutlich unter Ausnutzung einer unbekannten Schwachstelle)\n\n\n\nVerschiedene 5G/LTE-Geräte (wahrscheinlich aufgrund von Fehlkonfigurationen oder schwachen Anmeldeinformationen)",

The Daily Listen feature in Google’s Search Labs is rolling out to Android and iOS users in the US according to 9to5Google, and works similarly to the Audio Overviews feature for Google’s NotebookLM project.\nDaily Listen references search data and Discover feed interactions to assess which news articles would be of most interest to the user, and then summarizes those stories and topics into a roughly five-minute audio overview. It provides a text transcript, alongside audio scrubber controls that allow users to play, pause, mute, rewind, or skip to the next story.\n\n    \n   Image: Google (Via 9to5Google)\n   Here’s a few screengrabs of the Daily Listen UI, showing where the feature is located and how it presents related topics.\n \nSearch Labs users who opt-in to try this experiment will find Daily Listen in the personalized widget carousel underneath the Search bar at the top of the Google app. A “Related stories” tab will appear at the bottom of the audio player that corresponds to content within the overview that allows users to like or disapprove of each story with a thumbs up/down, and explore new topics.\nThere’s currently no word on when/if this feature will be rolled out to the wider public. Google’s AI Search Overviews were tested in a similar way via Search Labs before launching to a general audience last year, so it’s possible that Daily Listen may one day become a persistent feature — hopefully one that’s easier to opt out of than AI Overviews.",

      "link": "https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html?src=rss",
      "contentSnippet": "When it comes to gaming, laptops have come a long way. Once seen as the lesser cousin to gaming PCs, today’s gaming laptops pack a serious punch, offering remarkable power and portability in sleek packages. Whether you’re exploring open-world RPGs, dominating multiplayer arenas or creating content on the side, modern gaming laptops deliver performance that can rival many desktop rigs, with the added bonus of being able to game wherever you want.One of the biggest advantages of a laptop is its flexibility. You don’t need to worry about bulky setups or being tethered to one spot. Plus, with features like displays with high refresh rates, powerful GPUs and cutting-edge processors, these machines are more than capable of handling AAA titles, eSports and even VR gaming. Many laptops now come equipped with RGB-lit keyboards, advanced cooling systems and next-gen SSD storage to keep up with your gaming needs, too. We’ve tested a number of the latest gaming laptops to see which are worth your money. \nWhat to look for in a gaming laptop \nPrice  \nYour laptop buying journey starts and ends with the amount of money you're willing to spend. No surprise there. The good news: There are plenty of options for gamers of every budget. In particular, we're seeing some great entry-level PC gaming choices under $1,000, like Dell's G15 lineup. A cheap gaming laptop in this price range will definitely feel a bit flimsier than pricier models, and they'll likely skimp on RAM, storage and overall power. But most cheaper laptops should be able to handle the majority of video games running at 1080p at 60 frames per second, which is the bare minimum you'd want from any system. \nThings get interesting when you start looking at the best gaming laptops in the mid-range space, with prices at $1,000 and higher. At that point, you'll start finding PCs like the ASUS Zephyrus ROG G14, one of our favorite gaming notebooks. In general, you can look forward to far better build quality than budget gaming laptops (metal cases!), improved graphics power and enough RAM and storage space to handle the most demanding games. These are the gaming machines we'd recommend for most people, as they'll keep you gaming and working for years before you need to worry about an upgrade. \nIf you're willing to spend around $1,800 or more, you can start considering more premium options like Razer's Blade, which is on-par with some of the best gaming PCs. Expect impeccably polished cases, the fastest hardware on the market, and ridiculously thin designs. The sky's the limit here: Alienware's uber customizable Area 51m is an enormous beast that can cost up to $4,700. Few people need a machine that high-end, but if you're a gamer with extra cash to burn, it may be worth taking a close look at some of these pricier systems. \n\n \n \n \nCPU and GPU \nThe answer to this question used to be relatively simple: Just get an Intel chip with an NVIDIA GPU. But over the last few years AMD has stepped up its game with its Ryzen notebook processors, which are better suited for juggling multiple tasks at once (like streaming to Twitch while blasting fools in Fortnite). Intel responded with its impressive 12th and 13th-gen chips, but it’s nice to have decent Ryzen AMD alternatives available, especially since they’re often cheaper than comparable Intel models. \nWhen it comes to video cards, though, AMD is still catching up. Its Radeon RX 6000M GPU has been a fantastic performer in notebooks like ASUS’s ROG Strix G15, but it lags behind NVIDIA when it comes to newer features like ray tracing. (We’re still waiting to test AMD’s new Radeon 7000 series mobile graphics.) At the very least, a Radeon-powered notebook can approach the general gaming performance of the NVIDIA RTX 3070 and 3080 GPUs. \nIf you want to future-proof your purchase, or you’re just eager to see how much better ray tracing can make your games look, you’re probably better off with an NVIDIA video card. They’re in far more systems, and it’s clear that they have better optimized ray tracing technology. NVIDIA GeForce RTX GPUs also feature the company’s DLSS technology, which uses AI to upscale games to higher resolutions. That’ll let you play a game like Destiny 2 in 4K with faster frame rates. That’s useful if you’re trying to take advantage of a high refresh rate monitor. \nYou’ll still find plenty of laptops with NVIDIA’s older RTX 30-series GPUs these days, and they’ll still give you tremendous performance. But to be safe, it’s probably worth opting for the newer RTX 40-series systems, since they support the newer DLSS 3 technology and offer a wealth of performance upgrades. (If you’re looking out for the best deals, you can probably find some killer RTX 3070 laptops out there.) The entry-level RTX 4050 is a solid start, but we’d suggest going for a 4060 or 4070 if you’re aiming to maximize your framerates on faster screens. The RTX 4080 and RTX 4090 are both incredibly powerful, but they typically make systems far too expensive for most users. \nIt’s worth noting that NVIDIA’s mobile graphics cards aren’t directly comparable to its more powerful desktop hardware. PC makers can also tweak voltages to make gaming performance better in a thinner case. Basically, these laptops may not be desktop replacements — don’t be surprised if you see notebooks that perform very differently, even if they’re all equipped with the same GPU. \n\n \n \n \nScreen and refresh rate \nScreen size is a good place to start when judging gaming notebooks. In general, 15-inch laptops will be the best balance of immersion and portability, while larger 17-inch models are heftier, but naturally give you more screen real estate. There are some 13-inch gaming notebooks, like the Razer Blade Stealth, but paradoxically you'll often end up paying more for those than slightly larger 15-inch options. We’re also seeing plenty of 14-inch options, like the Zephyrus G14 and Blade 14, which are generally beefier than 13-inch laptops while still being relatively portable. \nBut these days, there is plenty to consider beyond screen size. For one: refresh rates. Most monitors refresh their screens vertically 60 times per second, or at 60Hz. That's a standard in use since black and white NTSC TVs. But over the past few years, displays have evolved considerably. Now, 120Hz 1080p screens are the bare minimum you'd want in any gaming notebook — and there are faster 144Hz, 240Hz and even 360Hz panels. All of this is in the service of one thing: making everything on your display look as smooth as possible. \nFor games, higher refresh rates also help eliminate screen tearing and other artifacts that could get in the way of your frag fest. And for everything else, it just leads to a better viewing experience. Even scrolling a web page on a 120Hz or faster monitor is starkly different from a 60Hz screen. Instead of seeing a jittery wall of text and pictures, everything moves seamlessly, as if you're unwinding a glossy paper magazine. Going beyond 120Hz makes gameplay look even more responsive, which to some players gives them a slight advantage. \n\n \n \n Steve Dent/Engadget \n \n \nNot to make things more complicated, but you should also keep an eye out for NVIDIA's G-SYNC and AMD's FreeSync. They're both adaptive sync technologies that can match your screen's refresh rate with the framerate of your game. That also helps to reduce screen tearing and make gameplay smoother. Consider them nice bonuses on top of one of the best gaming monitors with a high refresh rate; they're not necessary, but they can still offer a slight visual improvement. \nSee Also: \n \n Best Laptops for 2023 \n Best Cheap Windows Laptops \n Best 2-in-1 Laptops for 2023 \n Best Chromebooks \n Best Laptops for College Students \n \nOne more thing: Most of these suggestions are related to LCD screens, not OLEDs. While OLED makes a phenomenal choice for TVs, it's a bit more complicated when it comes to gaming laptops. They're mostly limited to 60Hz, though some models offer 90Hz. Still, you won’t see the smoothness of a 120Hz or 144Hz screen. OLEDs also typically come as 4K or 3.5K panels – you'll need a ton of GPU power to run games natively at that resolution. They look incredible, with the best black levels and contrast on the market, but we think most gamers would be better off with an LCD. \n\n \n \n Devindra Hardawar/Engadget \n \n \nOther things to remember when buying a gaming laptop: \n \n Get at least 16GB of RAM. And if you're planning to do a ton of multitasking while streaming, 32GB is worth considering. \n Storage is still a huge concern. These days, I'd recommend aiming for a 1TB M.2 SSD, which should be enough space to juggle a few large titles like Destiny 2. (If you can afford the jump to a 2TB SSD though, just do it.) Some laptops also have room for standard SATA hard drives, which are far cheaper than M.2's and can hold more data. \n Get your hands on a system before you buy it. I'd recommend snagging the best gaming laptop for you from a retailer with a simple return policy, like Amazon or Best Buy. If you don't like it, you can always ship it back easily. \n Don't forget about accessories! For the best performance, you'll need a good mouse, keyboard and a headset — these are some of the best gaming accessories for gaming PCs and laptops. \n \nHow we test gaming laptops \nWe review gaming laptops with the same amount of rigor as we approach traditional notebooks. We test build quality by checking cases for any undesirable flexible spots, as well as the strength of screen hinges during furious typing and Halo Infinite sessions. We benchmark every gaming notebook with PCMark 10, a variety of 3DMark tests, Cinebench and Geekbench. We also use NVIDIA’s Frameview app to measure the average framerates in Cyberpunk 2077, Halo Infinite and other titles. For media creation, we transcode a 4K movie clip into 1080p using Handbrake’s CPU and GPU encoding options. \nDisplays are tested under indoor and outdoor lighting with productivity apps, video playback and gameplay. We also try to stress the full refresh rate of every gaming notebook’s screen by benchmarking Halo Infinite, Overwatch 2 and other titles. Laptop speakers are judged by how well they can play back music, movies and the occasional game session with detail and clarity, and without any obvious distortion. \nWhen it comes to battery life, we see how long gaming systems last with a mixture of real-world productivity apps and gameplay, and we also test with PCMark 10’s “Modern office” battery test. In addition, we’re judging the quality of a machine’s keyboard with typing tests as well as relative accuracy and comfort during extended gaming sessions. \nBest gaming laptops for 2025 \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \n\n \nOther gaming laptops we’ve tested \nFramework Laptop 16 \nWe were eager to test the Framework Laptop 16 since it promised both modular customizability and a decent amount of gaming power. But while we appreciated just how repairable and upgradeable it is, its actual gaming performance was middling for its high price. You could always buy it without the additional GPU, but that makes it more of a daily workhorse than a gaming system. \nMSI Stealth Studio 14 \nOn a brighter note, we were pleased to see MSI return to form with the Stealth Studio 14, which is far faster and more attractive than the previous model. \nRazer Blade 16 and 18 \nWe were amazed to see a genuine 4K/1080p native screen in the Razer Blade 16, but it’s far too expensive and impractical, even for such a pricey brand. Similarly, we found the Razer Blade 18 to be both oversized and overpriced.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/laptops/best-gaming-laptops-172033838.html?src=rss",

      "link": "https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-docking-station-160041863.html?src=rss",
      "contentSnippet": "Laptops have long rivaled desktops in terms of power. But those slim and portable machines lack something their tower-shaped cousins tend to have in abundance: ports. Docking stations let you plug in monitors, mice, keyboards, storage devices and more using just a single port on your laptop. And if you're someone who relocates with your laptop often, a docking station makes it easier to get all your accessories connected again when you’re back at your desk. We tested out more than 15 highly rated docking stations and considered monitor support, number and type of ports, design and price to help you determine which one is the best docking station for your home or office setup. \nTable of contents \n \n Best docking stations \n What to look for in a docking station \n How we tested docking stations \n Other laptop docking stations we tested \n Docking station FAQs \n \nBest docking stations \n\n \nBack to top \n\n \nBack to top \n\n \nBack to top \n\n \nBack to top \nWhat to look for in a docking station \nFirst and foremost, consider what you need to plug in. This will likely be the deciding factor when you go to actually buy a docking station. Do you need three screens for an expanded work view? A quick way to upload photos from an SD card? Are you looking to plug in a webcam, mic and streaming light, while simultaneously taking advantage of faster Ethernet connections? Are you hooking up a gaming laptop to multiple displays and peripherals? Once you’ve settled on the type of ports you need, you may also want to consider the generation of those ports as well; even ports with the same shape can have different capabilities. Here’s a brief overview of the connectivity different docking stations offer. \nMonitor ports \nExternal monitors typically need one of three ports to connect to a PC: HDMI, DisplayPort or USB-C. HDMI connections are more common than DisplayPort and the cables and devices that use them are sometimes more affordable. The most popular version of the DisplayPort interface (v1.4) can handle higher resolutions and refresh rates than the most common HDMI version (2.0). All of the display docking stations with HDMI ports that we recommend here use version 2.0, which can handle 4K resolution at 60Hz or 1080p up to 240Hz. The DisplayPort-enabled docks support either version 1.2, which allows for 4K resolution at 60Hz, or version 1.4, which can handle 8K at 60Hz or 4K at 120Hz. \nYou can also use your dock’s downstream (non-host) Thunderbolt ports to hook up your monitors. If your external display has a USB-C socket, you can connect directly. If you have an HDMI display or DisplayPort-only monitor, you can use an adapter or a conversion cable. \nOf course, the number of monitors you can connect and the resolutions/rates they’ll achieve depend on both your computer’s GPU and your monitors — and the more monitors you plug in can bring down those numbers as well. Be sure to also use cables that support the bandwidth you’re hoping for. MacOS users should keep in mind that MacBooks with the standard M1 or M2 chips support just one external monitor natively and require DisplayLink hardware and software to support two external displays. MacBooks with M1 Pro, M2 Pro or M2 Max chips can run multiple monitors from a single port. \nUSB ports \nMost docking stations offer a few USB Type-A ports, which are great for peripherals like wired mice and keyboards, bus-powered ring lights and flash drives. For faster data transfer speeds to your flash drive, go for USB-A sockets labeled 3.1 or 3.2 — or better yet, use a USB-C Thunderbolt port. \nType-C USB ports come in many different flavors. The Thunderbolt 3, 4 and USB4 protocols are newer, more capable specifications that support power delivery of up to 100W, multiple 4K displays and data transfer speeds of up to 40Gbps. Other USB-C ports come in a range of versions, with some supporting video, data and power and some only able to manage data and power. Transfer rates and wattages can vary from port to port, but most docks list the wattage or GB/s on either the dock itself or on the product page. And again, achieving the fastest speeds will depend on factors like the cables you use and the devices you’re transferring data to. \nNearly every dock available today is a USB-C docking station, connecting to a computer via USB-C, often Thunderbolt, and those host ports are nearly always labeled with a laptop icon. They also allow power delivery to your laptop: available wattage varies, but most docks are rated between 85 and 100 watts. That should be enough to keep most computers powered — and it also means you won’t have to take up an extra laptop connector for charging. \nOther ports \nNone of our currently recommended laptops include an Ethernet jack; a docking station is a great way to get that connection back. We all know objectively that wired internet is faster than Wi-Fi, but it might take running a basic speed comparison test to really get it on a gut level. For reference, on Wi-Fi I get about a 45 megabit-per-second download speed. Over Ethernet, it’s 925 Mbps. If you pay for a high-speed plan, but only ever connect wirelessly, you’re probably leaving a lot of bandwidth on the table. Every docking station I tested includes an Ethernet port, and it could be the connector you end up getting the most use out of. \nJust two of our favorite laptops have SD card readers, and if you need a quick way to upload files from cameras or audio recorders, you may want to get a dock with one of those slots. Of the docks we tested, about half had SD readers. For now, most (but not all) laptops still include a 3.5mm audio jack, but if you prefer wired headphones and want a more accessible place to plug them in, many docking stations will provide. \nWhen you’re counting up the ports for your new dock, remember that most companies include the host port (the one that connects to your computer) in the total number. So if you’re looking for a dock with three Thunderbolt connections, be sure to check whether one of them will be used to plug in your laptop. \n\n \n \n \nDesign \nMost docking stations have either a lay-flat or upright design. Most docks put the more “permanent” connections in back — such as Ethernet, DC power, monitor connections and a few USBs. Up-front USB ports can be used for flash drive transfers, or even acting as a charger for your phone (just make sure the port can deliver the power you need). USBs in the rear are best for keyboards, mice, webcams and other things you’re likely to always use. Some docks position the host port up front, which might make it easier to plug in your laptop when you return to your desk, but a host port in back may look neater overall. \nBack to top \nHow we tested docking stations \nWe started out by looking at online reviews, spec sheets from various brands and docking stations that our fellow tech sites have covered. We considered brands we’ve tested before and have liked, and weeded out anything that didn’t have what we consider a modern suite of connections (such as a dock with no downstream USB-C ports). We narrowed it down to 12 contenders and I tested each dock in a home office, using an M1 MacBook Pro, a Dell XPS 13 Plus and an Acer Chromebook Spin 514. \nI plugged in and evaluated the quality of the connections for 12 different peripherals including a 4K and an HD monitor, a 4K and an HD webcam, plus USB devices like a mouse, keyboard, streaming light and mic. I plugged in wired earbuds, and transferred data to a USB-C flash drive and an external SSD. I ran basic speed tests on the Ethernet connections as well as the file transfers. I judged how easy the docks were to use as well as the various design factors I described earlier. I made spreadsheets and had enough wires snaking around my work area that my cat stayed off my desk for three weeks (a new record). \nAs new docking stations come out and we find models worthy of testing, (there are a couple from Ugreen we have our eye on), we'll update this guide accordingly. \nBack to top \nOther laptop docking stations we tested \nPlugable TBT4-UDZ \nWhen I pulled the Plugable TBT4-UDZ Thunderbolt 4 out of the box, I was convinced it would make the cut: It has a practical upright design, an attractive metal finish, and the host connection is TB4. While there are plenty of USB-A and monitor ports, there’s just one downstream USB-C. A modern dock, particularly one that costs $300, should let you run, say, a USB-C cam and mic at the same time. Otherwise, it’s pretty limiting. \nAnker 575 USB-C \nAt $250 (and more often $235), the Anker 575 USB-C could make for a good budget pick for Windows. It performed well with the Dell XPS 13 Plus, but had trouble with the third screen, the 4K webcam and headphone jack when connected to the MacBook Pro. It’s quite compact, which means it can get wobbly when a bunch of cables are plugged in, but it has a good selection of ports and was able to handle my basic setup well. \nBelkin Connect Pro Thunderbolt 4 \nBelkin’s Connect Pro Thunderbolt 4 Dock is a contender for a Thunderbolt 4 alternative. It has nearly the same ports as the AD2010 (minus the microSD slot) and an attractive rounded design — but it’s $90 more, so I’d only recommend getting it if you find it on sale. \nAcer USB Type-C Dock \nAcer’s USB Type-C Dock D501 costs $10 more than our Kensington pick for Chromebooks, but it performs similarly and is worth a mention. It has nearly the same ports (including the rather limiting single downstream USB-C) but both the Ethernet and data transfer speeds were faster. \nBack to top \nDocking station FAQs \nAre docking stations worth it? \nDocking stations are worth it if you have more accessories to plug in than your laptop permits. Say you have a USB-C camera and mic, plus a USB-A mouse, keyboard and streaming light; very few modern laptops have enough connections to support all of that at once. A docking station can make that setup feasible while also giving you extra ports like a gigabit Ethernet connection, and supplying power to your laptop. However, if you just need a few extra USB sockets, you might be better off going with a hub, as those tend to be cheaper. \nHow much does a laptop dock cost? \nLaptop docking stations tend to be bigger and more expensive than simple USB-A or USB-C hubs, thanks to the wider array of connections. You can find them as low as $50 and they can get as expensive as $450. A reasonable price for a dock with a good selection of ports from a reputable brand will average around $200. \nHow do I set up my laptop dock? \nMost docking stations are plug and play. First, connect the DC power cable to the dock and a wall outlet. Then look for the “host” or upstream port on the dock — it’s almost always a USB-C/Thunderbolt port and often branded with an icon of a laptop. Use the provided cable to connect to your computer. After that, you can connect your peripherals to the dock and they should be ready to use with your laptop. A few docking stations, particularly those that handle more complex monitor setups, require a driver. The instructions that come with your dock will point you to a website where you can download that companion software. \nDoes a laptop charge on a docking station? \nNearly all docking stations allow you to charge your laptop through the host connection (the cable running from the dock to your computer). That capability, plus the higher number of ports is what separates a docking station from a hub. Docks can pass on between 65W and 100W of power to laptops, and nearly all include a DC adapter. \nAre all docking stations compatible with all laptops? \nNo, not all docking stations are compatible with every laptop. In our tests, the Chromebook had the biggest compatibility issues, the Dell PC had the least, and the MacBook fell somewhere in between. All docks will list which brands and models they work with on the online product page — be sure to also check the generation of your laptop as some docks can’t support certain chips. \nWhat are some popular docking station brands? \nKensington, Anker, Pluggable and Belkin are reputable and well-known brands making docking stations for all laptops. Lenovo, Dell and HP all make docks that will work with their own computers as well as other brands.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/best-docking-station-160041863.html?src=rss",

      "link": "https://www.csoonline.com/article/3622920/soar-buyers-guide-11-security-orchestration-automation-and-response-products-and-how-to-choose.html",
      "contentSnippet": "Security orchestration, automation, and response (SOAR) has undergone a major transformation in the past few years. Features in each of the words in its description that were once exclusive to SOAR have bled into other tools. For example, responses can be found now in endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools. Orchestration is now a joint effort with security information and event management (SIEM) tools. \n\n\n\nMany of these features are now found in managed security products that go by other names, such as threat and incident response or cloud security posture management (CSPM). And many of the SOAR tools are no longer just focused on security but have expanded to cover the wider context of how an enterprise infrastructure operates.\n\n\n\n[ Download our editors’ PDF security orchestration, automation, and remediation (SOAR) tools buyer’s guide today! ]\n\n\n\nIn this buyer’s guide\n\n\n\n\nSOAR defined\n\n\n\nWhy you might need SOAR\n\n\n\nTrends in the SOAR market\n\n\n\nKey SOAR features to look for\n\n\n\nThe major SOAR providers and their offerings\n\n\n\nWhat about the price of SOAR?\n\n\n\nQuestions to ask your team and your SOAR vendor\n\n\n\nEssential reading\n\n\n\n\nWhat is SOAR\n\n\n\nThe SOAR category originated back in 2015 — the term created by Gartner — when virtualization and containers were first coming into enterprise networks and applications, greatly expanding the threat and attack surface areas.\n\n\n\nSOAR helps to orchestrate and integrate a wide tool collection using automation to perform repetitive and simple tasks, and to produce predefined playbooks that IT staff can use to reduce their risk profiles and response to attacks by bad actors. The category has seen major changes, with numerous acquisitions as the major vendors such as Checkpoint, Cisco, Google, IBM, Microsoft, and Palo Alto Networks have bulked up their platforms with SOAR-like features.\n\n\n\nSome analysts have soured on SOAR as it has undergone this transformation and as its features can now be found in other products. Ironically, Gartner has said that SOAR tools have not kept pace with changing requirements, putting them at the very bottom of their “hype cycle” — meaning that the innovation portion of SOAR is mostly a thing of the past. But even they admit that SOAR functionality has staying power and can be found in numerous other security tools.\n\n\n\nForrester Research partitions SOAR products into several categories: platforms, products that focus on threat intelligence, and those that are more centered around automation tasks. GigaOm divides the space into its own three categories of SOAR-only pure plays, full security platforms that integrate with other tool collections, and crossover products that originate from IT service management and automation segments. However you slice it, the SOAR market segment has more than 30 vendors.\n\n\n\nWhy you might need SOAR\n\n\n\nThe core reason for SOAR originally was it would be a major kingpin in an organization’s defensive posture. They were the first tools to not just discover a potential threat but automate a way to remove it and improve overall security. The goal was — and still is — to reduce the amount of time before a threat is found and resolved.\n\n\n\nAs security alerts have proliferated, the need to quickly classify and resolve them has gotten greater. “Day-to-day tactical activities take up too much time,” said Forrester’s Allie Mellen in the SOAR report. “SOAR technology provides security teams a way to automate some of these repetitive tasks and coordinate across tools from a single technology.”\n\n\n\nHowever, in recent years, as malware has gotten sneakier and attackers more adept, SOAR is just one weapon against these threats. Security has become more nuanced and integrated with case management and collaboration tools to become more effective. Some SOAR vendors have added machine learning techniques so that past events can help improve detection and eliminate false positives annoyances. Machine learning is of course not unique to SOAR and further blurs the lines between SOAR and other security tools that tout more autonomous operations and threat responses.\n\n\n\nThese are all great reasons, but one mitigating factor against SOAR is that these are expensive products, with prices around $300,000 per year or more. While there could be savings in not hiring additional SOC analysts or in finding malware quickly with the right SOAR, it could also mean that you might require hiring other analysts who need to be experienced with creating automated workflows to operate these products.\n\n\n\nTrends in the SOAR market\n\n\n\nLarge security vendors have widened their integrations with other vendors’ SOAR products, with some offering hundreds of third-party integrations. This means they can ingest various security signals such as SIEM tools, log analyzers, and endpoint detectors. This means “that SOAR tools can start running independently of SIEM tools to strengthen an organization’s security posture and automate nonsecurity processes as well,” said GigaOm’s Andrew Green in his October 2024 report linked above.\n\n\n\nOne example of this trend is the recently announced Security Incident Response service from AWS. This brings together a collection of various signals from across the entire AWS collection, tying together its GuardDuty and Security Hub monitoring services along with a human incident response team.\n\n\n\nMany vendors have tied their SOAR and SIEM tools together, such as Palo Alto Networks’ Cortex, Microsoft’s Sentinel, and Netwitness’ Orchestrator. Swimlane and D3Security offer only a SOAR product, and both have wide third-party integrations.\n\n\n\nAnother trend is from a growing threat from API-based attacks and increasing sophistication. Kong has found in its latest survey that half of respondents have experienced these threats in the past year. This means that better detection and response automation is needed, with a broader scope to figure out what is going on across an enterprise network.\n\n\n\nOne way to do this is to leverage AI and machine learning. For example, according to AIM Research, “vendors are broadening their offerings with genAI-powered AI agents, copilots, context-aware AI assistants, automation and analytics security platforms, and attack training simulators. We are now noticing a rise in the integration of generative AI-specific capabilities into cybersecurity tools.” Swimlane Turbine SOAR and BlinkOps both have their AI copilots and AI-infused low-code playbook generators. Fortinet has its FortAI and Google has its Gemini AI SecLM module that can provide more contextual guidance and execute commands.\n\n\n\nAnomali has taken another approach. It doesn’t sell a separate standalone SOAR product, but adds its functionality with its AI-based copilot to its SIEM Security Analytics and ThreatStream intelligence tools. OpenText does something similar with its Enterprise Security Manager, essentially tossing in SOAR and AI functionality as part of the overall package.\n\n\n\nBut AI by itself means a staff needs to coordinate what is being automated and when. Forrester’s Mellen recommended in 2022 that security teams should “coordinate with other automation talent in other parts of the business,” such as with staff of a “center of excellence” to help build better SOC automation processes. “Often, companies have a lone analyst who maintains their SOAR tool,” and this collaboration could have big payoffs.\n\n\n\nFinally, the best SOAR products come in a variety of packages: for on-premises installations as either a dedicated hardware appliance or standalone software and one of three virtual configurations including as a virtual machine image, a public cloud service or as full SaaS/managed service. This gives these tools flexibility in where they are placed across an enterprise infrastructure and what they are protecting. No SOAR vendor offers all these options. Fortinet, Rapid7, and ServiceNow offer hardware options (but not all of the others), while Palo Alto Networks, Swimlane, and Tines offer all other options except the hardware package.\n\n\n\nKey features to look for\n\n\n\nSOAR products span a wide range of features and protective measures. Here are a few of the key features that can differentiate them:\n\n\n\n\nHow wide is the third-party integration envelope? Each SOAR vendor claims to have hundreds of integrations to others’ products, which is part of the product category’s secret sauce. But that means the SOAR experience can vary widely from installation to installation. Just citing the raw number of integrations is meaningless: for example, a vendor can integrate with dozens or more AWS services, or just S3, so it pays to get the specifics. We have linked to the online catalogs where available.\n\n\n\nHow many prebuilt workflows come included? BlinkOps claims thousands of automated flowflows, but just as important is the process to create custom ones. Some vendors offer visual low-code editors or AI-enhanced creation tools.\n\n\n\nHow does the product avoid alert fatigue and false positives? The best tools cross-reference their signals to filter out false positives, such as leveraging multiple threat intelligence sources. Tines has a rather innovative way to use a Notion database combined with Elastic Security. D3Security claims its product can eliminate at least 90% of alerts automatically and has a free ROI calculator that possibly can quantify their benefit. Microsoft claims its tool eliminates up to 84% of false positives.\n\n\n\nWhat about finding zero-day threats? Again, combining signals and feeds with automation processes can help to more quickly identify and neutralize zero-days.\n\n\n\nDoes the product serve nonsecurity or general orchestration purposes? As mentioned in the individual specifics of each product, some of the SOAR tools have branched out into nonsecurity areas, such as tracking file access and network traffic, or tracking employee life cycle and asset management or synchronizing with trouble ticketing systems and general application development alerts. Many vendors, with the notable exceptions of Google’s SOAR and Microsoft’s Sentinel, are already moving in this direction.\n\n\n\n\nThe major SOAR providers and their offerings\n\n\n\nBlinkOps from Blink has hundreds of integrations listed here that span a wide variety of third-party software tools. It has thousands of prebuilt automated workflows (for example, Google Cloud Platform has 360 such automations) that span those that can run on preset schedules or with particular web hook triggers. It comes with two different AI copilots, one for building new workflows and one for automated case management. It also supports non-security automation and orchestration uses. Pricing starts at $17,500 per year.\n\n\n\nD3Security Smart SOAR has more than 600 connectors to a variety of tools. The company says it will build anything that isn’t in this list for free. It has automations that handle incidents, search for false positives, and trigger mitigation responses. D3 also handles nonsecurity cases, such as employee onboarding and offboarding. The minimum annual price is $100,000. It plans to add a series of AI-based tools in early 2025 to help make customization more productive and effective.\n\n\n\nFortinet FortiSOAR has more than 600 connectors to a variety of other tools as well as tight integrations with other Fortinet products such as its SIEM, firewall, and XDR. Data is enriched with hundreds of threat intelligence sources, and the companion FortAI tool provides more analysis, creates playbooks, and executes simple commands. It can also be used for nonsecurity tasks such as employee onboarding or offboarding and equipment provisioning. It is available in SaaS, on-premises software, and cloud versions. Pricing comes in two tiers: starter and enterprise.\n\n\n\nGoogle Security Operations SOAR is just one module of many components that have their roles in its Chronicle observability service. It supports more than 250 third-party integrations across all major security categories, including gathering data from various Google security and cloud services. It requires a SIEM connection (Google’s or others) to collect data. It works with Mandiant’s threat intelligence and alerts are sent in near real-time to the SOAR dashboard. It has a three-tier pricing structure.\n\n\n\nIBM QRadar SOAR on-premises. In early 2024, IBM sold its QRadar SaaS version to Palo Alto Networks, keeping the Open Shift and virtual machine. It supports more than 300 third-party integrations listed in its marketplace, along with connectors to its Guardium and Verify product lines. QRadar also integrates with its Watson AI-based app dev studio, which when coupled with its Playbook Designer can be used to develop custom playbooks and workflows. It has been extended to nonsecurity use cases, such as employee onboarding and management. Unlike most of its competitors, it has a very transparent pricing estimator, based on the number of authorized users, that starts around $10,000 per year.\n\n\n\nMicrosoft Sentinel is a cloud-native dual SIEM and SOAR service that uses Azure analytic services. It can collect data from multiple cloud and on-premises sources with a variety of connectors, including prebuilt ones for its own Defender products as well as third-party tools such as AWS S3, various Google Cloud services, Jira Audit, and Okta that can be found on the Azure Marketplace. Microsoft has also written extensive migration plans from Splunk and QRadar SOAR tools and has AI-enhanced automation of workbooks with its Azure Logic Apps tool. It is available as a preview version with various usage-based pricing tiers but without the need for an 365/E5 Defender license, and free to try out for the first month with certain usage limits.\n\n\n\nPalo Alto Networks Cortex XSOAR has more than 1,000 third-party integrations that can be reviewed on its marketplace covering both security and nonsecurity tools. The product has integrations with other security, network, and cloud tools from the vendor. It uses AI-enhancements to group and filter duplicate alerts, eliminate false positives, and create playbooks as well as learning from manual analyst interactions. XSOAR also works with a variety of large language models, including ChatGPT, Anything LLM, and Ollama, to analyze and interact with incident data.\n\n\n\nServiceNow Security Incident Response supports hundreds of third-party integrations across a wide variety of security products to enrich its data collection of incidents. This includes connecting with many ServiceNow modules for security, network, compliance, asset collection, and other IT-related issues. It works with three AI-based tools: Flow Designer, a visual drag-and-drop workflow creator; Predictive AIOps, for analyzing event logs; and Now Assist, for case management.\n\n\n\nSplunk SOAR. Cisco completed its acquisition of Splunk early in 2024 and it now integrates with more than 300 third-party tools and Splunk’s Enterprise Security and Attack Analyzer products. It comes with more than 2,800 prebuilt automated workflows that can be easily tied to playbooks that can be constructed with a visual editor. A future integration is promised with Cisco’s Talos Intelligence threat feed. Splunk has an AI assistant for its Search Processing Language, enabling natural language prompting of queries. Splunk can also be applied to nonsecurity cases such as IT operations.\n\n\n\nSwimlane Turbine has a wide catalog of hundreds of third-party integrations to a variety of security tools. This is enabled thanks to support for a variety of connections, including general Rest APIs, webhooks, various telemetry sensors, and business logic tools. Swimlane claims to be the largest independent SOAR provider, meaning that it doesn’t offer any of its own SIEM or XDR companion products. It does have Turbine Canvas, an AI-based low-code automator, and Hero AI, used to automate playbooks for case management. Pricing starts at $720,000 per year, with additional usage fees (such as for AI consumption) on top of this.\n\n\n\nTines has an extensive ecosystem of dozens of prebuilt third-party integrations with vulnerability management, the three major cloud platforms, and various EDR and SIEM vendors. Users can quickly build workflows to automate processes, including using its AI-powered Workbench. It can also automate various nonsecurity tasks such as employee onboarding or offboarding and asset management. There are both always-free and for-fee versions that start at $170,000 per year and can easily be double that amount for more complex installations.\n\n\n\nOther SOAR providers include Exabeam, NetWitness, and SentinelOne; these providers declined to provide any specifics on their SOAR products.\n\n\n\nWhat about the price of SOAR?\n\n\n\nUnlike IBM and Microsoft, few of the SOAR vendors offer full public and transparent pricing. Three counter examples are Tines’s pricing page, Splunk’s pricing page, and Google’s pricing page. All of these are long on details on how their prices are calculated without providing any actual dollar amounts. The others just ignore pricing altogether.\n\n\n\nWe obtained pricing from cloud providers’ managed service offerings, which may or may not be representative of other packaging options. The range is quite large, starting at about $20,000 per year. The top cost goes to Swimlane, which starts at the jaw-dropping annual fee of $720,000 and can go a lot higher for usage surcharges. Clearly, SOAR isn’t just an acronym, and the lack of pricing transparency means the sky is the limit. Potential customers will have to negotiate with vendor sales teams to obtain meaningful pricing.\n\n\n\nQuestions to ask your team and your SOAR vendor\n\n\n\n\nDoes the product offer more protection and automation features than using either an XDR or SIEM tool?\n\n\n\nHow wide and agnostic is your support for multiple third-party security vendors?\n\n\n\nWhat integrations (to other security tools offered by the same vendor) are available? How is this data enriched and combined within the SOAR?\n\n\n\nHow is your workflow automation enabled?\n\n\n\nWhat large language models and AI tools are used to enhance its features?\n\n\n\n\nEssential Reading\n\n\n\n\nWhat is SIEM?

      "contentSnippet": "Illustration: The Verge\n  \n\n Apple is refuting rumors that it ever let advertisers target users based on Siri recordings in a statement published Wednesday evening describing how Siri works and what it does with data. \nThe section specifically responding to the rumors reads:\nApple has never used Siri data to build marketing profiles, never made it available for advertising, and never sold it to anyone for any purpose. We are constantly developing technologies to make Siri even more private, and will continue to do so. \nThe conspiracy theory the company is responding to resurfaced last week after Apple agreed to pay $95 million to settle a lawsuit over users whose conversations were captured by its Siri voice assistant and potentially overheard by human employees. \nWhile Apple’s settlement addresses an issue that The Guardian reported in 2019. The report showed human contractors tasked with reviewing anonymized recordings and grading whether the trigger was activated intentionally, would sometimes receive recordings of people discussing sensitive information. But it doesn’t include any reference to selling data for marketing purposes. \n\nHowever, reports about the settlement noted that in earlier filings like this one from 2021, some of the plaintiffs claimed that after they mentioned brand names like “Olive Garden,” “Easton bats,” “Pit Viper sunglasses,” and “Air Jordans,” they were served ads for corresponding products, which they attributed to Siri data. Apple’s statement tonight says that it “does not retain audio recordings of Siri interactions unless users explicitly opt in to help improve Siri, and even then, the recordings are used solely for that purpose. Users can easily opt-out at any time.” \nFacebook responded to similar theories in 2014 and 2016, before Mark Zuckerberg addressed it directly, saying “no” to the question while being grilled by Congress over the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018.\nSo, if Apple (and Facebook, Google, etc.) is telling the truth, then why would you see an ad later for something you only talked about? \nThere are other explanations, and attempts to check the rumors out include an investigation in 2018 that didn’t find evidence of microphone spying but did discover that some apps secretly recorded on-screen user activity that they shipped to third parties. \nAd targeting networks also track data from people logged onto the same network or who have spent time in the same locations, so even if one person didn’t type in that search term, maybe someone else did. They can buy data from brokers who collect reams of detailed location tracking and other info from the apps on your phone, and both Google and Facebook pull in data from other companies to build out profiles based on your purchasing habits and other information.",

      "contentSnippet": "The Detroit-based company Astrohaus has been making its “distraction-free writing tools” under the Freewrite name for about a decade. So far, those have all been standalone, single-purpose devices meant simply for drafting text, but Astrohaus is branching out at CES 2025. The company just announced a mechanical keyboard called the Freewrite Wordrunner, a device designed specifically with writers in mind.\nThis comes more than three years after Astrohaus quietly revealed intentions to build a keyboard, originally known as the Maestro. But the company eventually pulled the plug on its planned 2022 launch, and I hadn’t heard anything about it since then — it seems that they’ve just been working away at it this whole time. CEO Adam Leeb said in a press release that the company had been iterating and developing it for almost four years.\nFreewrite\nMechanical keyboards have largely become the domain of gamers; the company wanted to build a device for people who make their living writing instead. Without spending some quality time with it, I can’t say if they’ve hit that mark yet, but there are some fun ideas on display here.\nThe Wordrunner has a tenkeyless design that looks familiar at first glance, but you’ll quickly notice that the function row has been replaced by a custom set of keys that’ll make zipping around text documents faster. That includes find and replace, undo and redo, paragraph up and down as well as back, forward and reload keys. I’d be upset about losing media controls from the function row, but the Wordrunner has it covered with the bright red joystick / button. It moves in all four cardinal directions, can be turned like a knob and can also be pressed in vertically to skip tracks, change volume or pause your tunes.\nNathan Ingraham for Engadget\nOn the other side, you’ll find three customizable macro keys with the cutesy names “zap,” “pow” and “bam.” They’re programmable for anything you might want, but Astrohaus suggested using them to launch specific writing apps, converting text to title case or inserting the date. I don’t yet know what I’d use them for, but having customizable keys is a table-stakes feature for most enthusiast keyboards so I’m glad to see them here.\nProbably the most visually striking thing about the Wordrunner are the two mechanical counters you’ll see up top. One is a timer you can use for writing sprints or just staying focused for a bit. More intriguing is the Wordometer dead-center at the top of the keyboard. It’ll track your words with its whopping eight-digit mechanical counter, and since it saves your word count as long as you want, you could try and max it out someday. Of course, you can also reset it at any time or pause it if you don’t want it to advance while you’re chatting with friends or sending emails.\nNathan Ingraham for Engadget\nThe mechanical keys are backlit and use Kailh switches; the keycaps are replaceable but the switches aren't. It also has some sound dampening built in so you can use it without subjecting everyone around to you overly loud key clacks (this may be a plus or minus depending on how you like your keyboards). As for connectivity, the Wordrunner uses Bluetooth or USB-C, and you can pair the keyboard with three different devices and quickly switch between them with dedicated hotkeys.\nI got a chance to play with a prototype of the Wordrunner, and my first impressions was \"wow, this is heavy!\" It's a thick slab of polished aluminum that matches the finish of the premium Hemingway edition of the Smart Typewriter. Astrohaus founder / CEO Adam Leeb told me that the company was shooting to make this keyboard feel like a premium, limited edition with the finish even if they're planning for it to be part of the permanent portfolio.\nNathan Ingraham for Engadget\nWhile I didn't get to try the Wordrunner hooked up to a computer, I still got to see the mechanical Wordometer turn over when I started typing. It's quite satisfying to see it count up as I wrote an imaginary story on it, and there's a small LED that's green when the counter is turned on and red when you turn it off. The keys and travel all felt great, and the joystick was similarly a lovely tactile experience — I'm looking forward to using it like a volume knob for media. Leeb says that this keyboard is still a prototype, but it feels quite polished and nearly final to me. \nFinally, there’s the ever-present question of availability. Astrohaus is launching the Wordrunner on Kickstarter, as it has done with most of its other hardware over the last 10 years. The campaign should start in February with early bird pricing, but we don’t know what that price will be yet. Fortunately, there’s a pretty low-commitment way to get the best price if you’re curious. Astrohaus says you can place a $1 reservation for priority access and the best possible pricing, with plans to deliver the first batch of keyboards before the end of the year. That’s a long ways out, but a buck isn’t a bad investment if you’re interested.\nUpdate, January 8 2024, 9:27PM ET: This article has been updated to include some hands-on impressions and photos of the Wordrunner.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/computing/accessories/the-latest-freewrite-device-is-a-fancy-mechanical-keyboard-built-with-writers-in-mind-220005961.html?src=rss",

      "contentSnippet": "Apple today reiterated its commitment to Siri privacy, making it clear that ‌Siri‌ data has never been used to build marketing profiles, nor has any ‌Siri‌ information been made available to advertisers or sold for any purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nApple's newsroom post comes after it settled a class action lawsuit related to ‌Siri‌ for $95 million. Plaintiffs accused Apple of recording conversations captured after accidental ‌Siri‌ activations, and then sharing information from those conversations with third-party advertisers.\r\n\r\nTwo plaintiffs claimed that after speaking about products like Air Jordan shoes and Olive Garden, their Apple devices showed ads for those products, while another said he received ads for a surgical treatment after discussing it privately with his doctor.\r\n\r\nThere has never been any indication that Apple shared ‌Siri‌ recordings, and Apple told MacRumors in a statement earlier this week that the lawsuit was settled to avoid additional litigation.\r\n\r\nIn its full privacy overview, Apple goes into detail on the ‌Siri‌ privacy protections that are in place to keep user data safe. Apple uses on-device ‌Siri‌ processing wherever possible, and minimizes the amount of data that's collected as much as possible.\r\n\r\n‌Siri‌ searches and requests are not associated with an Apple Account and cannot be linked to an individual user, with Apple instead using a random identifier to keep track of data as it's processed.\r\n\r\nApple says that it does not retain audio recordings of ‌Siri‌ interactions unless users explicitly opt in to help improve ‌Siri‌, and even then, recordings are used just for that purpose.Tags: Apple Privacy, SiriThis article, \"Apple Highlights Privacy Commitment After Settling Siri Spying Lawsuit\" first appeared on MacRumors.comDiscuss this article in our forums",

      "link": "https://www.theverge.com/21289209/best-apple-watch-deals",
      "contentSnippet": "The latest Apple Watch SE is an entry-level smartwatch if there ever was one. | Photo by Amelia Holowaty Krales / The Verge\n  \n\n In September, Apple launched its latest smartwatch, introducing the Apple Watch Series 10 alongside a black rendition of the Apple Watch Ultra 2. Each wearable has its own pros and cons, as does the second-gen Apple Watch SE, but the recent introduction of the new wearables also means there are now more Apple Watch models on the market than ever before — and a lot more deals to be had.\n\nBut with all of those options, which one should you pick? Generally speaking, you want to buy the newest watch you can afford so that it continues to receive software updates from Apple. The latest update, watchOS 11, launched in September on the Apple Watch Series 6 and newer, ultimately leaving those still using an older Series 4 or Series 5 behind.\nThat being said, picking up a watch from the latest (or a recent) generation ensures you’re getting a smartwatch with an updated design, a robust number of features, and plenty of sensors.\nNow, let’s get to the deals.\n\nThe best Apple Watch Series 10 deals\n\n\nThe Apple Watch Series 10 represents the latest wearable in Apple’s flagship Series lineup. It features the new S10 SiP chip, faster charging, and a wide-angle OLED display that’s brighter, larger, and easier to read than that of previous models. It weighs half as much as the Ultra, too, and is about 30 percent thinner despite its new 42mm and 46mm sizing. Other upgrades include an added depth and water temperature sensor, as well as a new FDA-cleared sleep apnea detection feature, the latter of which is also available on the last-gen Series 9 and Ultra 2.\n\nWhile the improvements are certainly welcome, the Series 10 isn’t a vast departure from the prior model, the Series 9. That being said, you can already pick it up at Amazon and Best Buy in the 42mm sizing with GPS starting at $329 ($70 off), which matches the wearable's best price to date. The GPS-equipped model is also on sale at Amazon and Best Buy in the 46mm variant for $359 ($70 off), while the LTE models can be had at Amazon and Best Buy starting at $429 ($70 off).\n\nRead our Apple Watch Series 10 review.\nThe best Apple Watch Series 9 deals\n\n\nIn 2023, Apple introduced the Apple Watch Series 9 alongside the second-gen Ultra. It uses Apple’s last-gen S9 SiP chip and a second-gen ultra wideband chip, which allows for onboard Siri processing and precision finding with select iPhone models. It also features a brighter, 2,000-nit display and support for Apple’s nifty “double tap” feature — two minor additions that are also present on the Series 10.\n\nThe Series 9 has been out for more than a year, but certain configurations have become increasingly difficult to find with the arrival of Apple’s latest watch. Luckily, the GPS-equipped Series 9 is still on sale in the 45mm configuration at Walmart starting at $279 ($150 off), or at Amazon and Best Buy in the 41mm sizing starting at $299 ($100 off). There are also a handful of deals to be had on the LTE models with cellular connectivity, though none of them undercut the current price of the LTE-equipped Series 10 model by much, hence their exclusion here.\n\nRead our Apple Watch Series 9 review.\nThe best Apple Watch SE deals\n\n\nThe Apple Watch SE received a refresh in late 2022. It has the same chipset as the Series 8, which is great, but with fewer sensors, no always-on display, and a slightly outdated design compared to the Series 8, Series 9, and Series 10. Those omissions might take this out of the running for some people, but it still may be exactly what you’re after. Best of all, it starts at $249 for the 40mm Wi-Fi / GPS model, which is $30 less than the previous generation’s baseline cost. Opting for cellular connectivity bumps the starting price up to $299 for the 40mm size (44mm adds $20 to each configuration).\n\nAt the moment, the best deals on the latest Apple Watch SE can be found at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy, where you can pick the 40mm model with GPS for $199 ($50 off). The 44mm configuration, meanwhile, is available at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $229 ($50 off). If you want the LTE configuration, the 40mm configuration is currently on sale at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $249 ($50 off), or in the larger 44mm sizing at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy for $279 ($50 off), its typical sale price.\n\nRead our Apple Watch SE (second-gen) review.\nThe best Apple Watch Ultra 2 deals\n\nThe latest Apple Watch Ultra launched at $799 in September with GPS and LTE support, much like the original model. The ultra-capable smartwatch has the most features, sensors, and ruggedness of any Apple Watch model available thus far, along with a display that’s 50 percent brighter than the first Ultra. The 49mm smartwatch also packs Apple’s S9 SiP and second-gen ultra wideband chips, just like the Apple Watch Series 9, while maintaining long-lasting battery life, precise GPS tracking, and a bevy of diving-friendly sensors.\n\nIn recent months, we saw the Apple Watch Ultra 2 dip to as low as $642 ($157 off) in select configurations. Right now, however, it’s only on sale at Amazon and Best Buy with a Trail Loop starting at $719.99 (about $79 off), or with an Alpine Loop at Amazon starting at $759 ($40 off). You can also pick it up at Amazon with an Ocean Band starting at $769 ($30 off), which is about $80 more than the lowest price we’ve seen on the elastomer-equipped model.\n\nRead our Apple Watch Ultra 2 review.\nA note on the more premium models\nWhile all of the Apple Watch models and colorways covered here are encased in aluminum (except the Ultra 2, which has a titanium build), Apple does make a more premium range built out of stainless steel and titanium. These offerings are functionally and aesthetically similar to their aluminum counterparts, with slightly refined colors and finishings — polished for the stainless steel and brushed for the titanium. However, they start at much steeper prices of $699 and above. They, too, can often be found on sale, but they’re never discounted as low as the standard base models, so we don’t include them here.",

But elsewhere at the show, competitor Roborock was showing off its latest flagship, the Saros Z70, which has an arm that can pick up items like socks.\nNot to be outdone, Dreame then showed off a soon-to-be-released model at its CES booth, combining those two step-climbing legs with a robotic arm of its own.\n\n   \n\n\n \n View this post on Instagram\n\n \n  \n\n \n\n  \n\n  \nA post shared by The Verge (@verge)\n\n\n\nDreame’s model has a chunkier-looking arm than the Roborock’s, and it says it can pick up items up to 500 grams, whereas Roborock’s can only tackle items up to 300 grams. Dreame says its arm can pick up sneakers as large as men’s size 42 (a size 9 in the US) and take them to a designated spot in your home. The concept could apply to small toys and other items, and you’ll be able to designate specific areas for the robot to take certain items, such as toys to the playroom and shoes to the front door.\nHowever, I didn’t see the robot picking up a sneaker — or anything at all — apparently, the infamous CES show floor Wi-Fi couldn't hack it. Instead, they showed the robust-looking arm moving up, down, and around while the robot lifted itself up on its two small legs. It looked like a tiny horse.\n\n    \n   Photo by Jennifer Pattison Tuohy / The Verge\n   The robot vacuum lifting itself up on its legs while its arm stretches out.\n \nAnother interesting invention is a separate toolbox with various brushes that Dreame says the arm can connect to, enabling it to reach into corners and tight spaces where the bot itself cannot go and sweep out the dirt and dust. They also had a new base station that dispenses multiple mopping pads. This allows the robot to choose different pads for different jobs around your home — one for the kitchen another for the bathroom — to help avoid cross-contamination around your home. \nDreame’s Longdong Chen told The Verge that the step-climbing, tool-using, arm-touting bot should be available later this year. A price hasn’t been announced, but it’s a safe bet that it’ll cost an arm and a leg.",

      "contentSnippet": "At CES 2017, Faraday Future introduced its futuristic luxury EV, the FF 91. Seven years later, following repeated delays, bankruptcy, lawsuits and other controversies, the company has sold “15 or 16” FF 91s. Now the company is detailing its latest strategy shift, with a plan to sell cheap EVs under its newly announced low-cost “FX” brand. FX CEO Max Ma came to CES, along with two prototype vehicles, to pitch the plan that he described as a “fresh start” for the embattled company.\nAs you might expect with Faraday, the exact details are somewhat hazy, but it involves sourcing parts from Chinese car-makers and bringing them to the US to produce “mass volume mainstream vehicles” with some of the premium touches Faraday is known for. “We want to take that $300,000-car expertise from a technology and features and performance [standpoint] into a $30,000, $40,000 car to try to upgrade the overall user experience,” Ma said during a briefing with Engadget. The first FX vehicle, the flagship product of the brand’s lineup, will be a minivan or, as Ma referred to it, “an AI MPV.”\nFaraday showed off two prototype minivans to demonstrate the concept. We were not permitted to take photos but the vehicle in the photo at the top of this post is the one I saw.\nOne was meant to show the kind of premium in-cabin experience Faraday is envisioning for the low-cost car. It had two rows of white leather captain seats. The second-row seats had reclining footrests, heated seats and built-in massagers. There was also a small fridge underneath the center console for keeping drinks cold. The vehicle was missing its door handles and several other pieces. “Obviously, we’ll have door handles,” a Faraday rep assured us.\nThe second minivan was even less finished. The entire interior, including the dashboard and instrument cluster, was covered in black fabric held together with binder clips. But a Faraday rep took me and other reporters for a ride in it, driving in small, slow circles around a Las Vegas parking lot. Later, Faraday offered to let me take the minivan for a spin and I — apparently the “first lady” to pilot the vehicle — also drove it in slow circles around the parking lot. I’m not sure what I was supposed to get out of it, though, it felt like driving a minivan.\nFaraday claims it will start producing the yet-unnamed vehicle later this year, with the first car rolling off the production line by the end of 2025, according to a timeline shared by Ma. That’s a lofty promise considering the company’s past history of mismanagement and delays. Faraday Future CEO Matthias Aydt also acknowledged that the company has yet to finalize its partnerships with the companies that will supply its parts. He also didn’t address how tariffs may affect those plans.\nMa said he understood the skepticism. “Basically, this is a kind of fresh start. We really want to demonstrate that through our dedication of hard work, we can achieve what we promised.”This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/transportation/evs/faraday-future-pitches-a-fresh-start-with-a-minivan-prototype-at-ces-2025-010050459.html?src=rss",

      "contentSnippet": "Illustration by Haein Jeong / The Verge\n  \n\n Microsoft is rolling back a model upgrade to its AI-powered Bing Image Creator, reports TechCrunch. The rollback came after weeks of complaints by users that the tool just didn’t work as well after Microsoft “upgraded” to a new version of the DALL-E 3 model on December 18th.\nMicrosoft declined to comment on its decision to roll things back or offer specifics on what may be causing the gap between user’s expectations and its output.\nToday, Microsoft’s head of search, Jordi Ribas, tweeted that they could reproduce “some of the issues reported” and are reverting to an older version of the DALL-E model for now, although it could take a few weeks until it’s complete.\n\n\nSince the launch of Bing Image Creator last spring, users have generated billions of images with text prompts. I'm pleased to share our latest updates to enhance your creative experience. Starting today, we’re rolling out the latest DALL-E 3 model PR16, which will create images… pic.twitter.com/3p9HsYMlr6— Jordi Ribas (@JordiRib1) December 18, 2024\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThanks again for the feedback and patience. We've been able to repro some of the issues reported and plan to revert to PR13 until we can fix them. All Pro users and about 25% of the requests using boosts are now on PR13. The deployment process is very slow unfortunately. It…— Jordi Ribas (@JordiRib1) January 8, 2025\n\n\n\n\nAs soon as Ribas posted about the change in December, there were complaints that Bing Image Creator was producing less-detailed results or images that didn’t accurately reflect their prompts. In his initial replies, Ribas said the model’s output quality “should be a bit better on average” than before. \n\nIt was the same story in posts and comments on Reddit and OpenAI’s community forums. On OpenAI’s forums, a person complained about the model’s handling of fabric on an anime-style character’s dress. The person who posted the below images says the one on the left is “perfect quality” while the one on the right is “over-lit.”\n\n    \n   Screenshot: OpenAI community forum\n \nAnother didn’t like the way Bing placed starburst effects:\n\n    \n   Screenshot: OpenAI community forum\n \nAll of these things are subjective, and I can’t claim to think any of them look better than any others. If anything, it feels like an indication that Microsoft doesn’t just have to deal with complaints about bugs or people upset about feature changes — now it has to deal with AI art critics comparing the machine’s output to what they imagine it should create. Perhaps they should ask the artists whose work the generators were trained on for tips about managing a client’s expectations?",

      "contentSnippet": "IT software provider Ivanti released patches Wednesday for its Connect Secure SSL VPN appliances to address two memory corruption vulnerabilities, one of which has already been exploited in the wild as a zero-day to compromise devices.\n\n\n\nThe exploited vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2025-0282, is a stack-based buffer overflow rated as critical with a CVSS score of 9.0. The flaw can be exploited without authentication to achieve remote code execution and impacts Ivanti Connect Secure, Ivanti Policy Secure, and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA gateways.\n\n\n\nThe second vulnerability, CVE-2025-0283, is also a stack-based buffer overflow impacting the same products but requires authentication to exploit and can only lead to privilege escalation. It’s rated as high severity with a CVSS score of 7.0.\n\n\n\nAccording to Ivanti’s advisory, CVE-2025-0282 was exploited in “a limited number of customers’ Ivanti Connect Secure appliances” but the company is not aware of in-the-wild exploitation against Ivanti Policy Secure and Ivanti Neurons for ZTA gateways yet.\n\n\n\nAs for CVE-2025-0283, that vulnerability was discovered internally while investigating CVE-2025-0282, and there’s no evidence that it has been exploited. The flaws do not need to be chained for a successful attack.\n\n\n\nFor now, patches are available only for Ivanti Connect Secure, with patches for Policy Secure and Neurons planned for Jan. 21. That’s more than enough time for the patches to be reverse engineered and for proof-of-concept exploits to be developed and adopted by attackers.\n\n\n\nHowever, Ivanti points out that Policy Secure is not supposed to be exposed to the internet, lowering the risk. It advises all customers to make sure the appliance is configured according to official recommendations.\n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Neurons ZTA gateways cannot be exploited in production when connected to a ZTA controller. Only gateways generated and left unconnected are at risk of exploitation.\n\n\n\nFor Connect Secure the company advises customers to upgrade to version 22.7R2.5 and to perform scans with the internal and the external Integrity Checker Tool (ICT), which should detect signs of compromise.\n\n\n\n“Factory reset on appliances with a clean ICT scan is recommended before putting 22.7R2.5 in production out of an abundance of caution,” the company said.\n\n\n\nThe CVE-2025-0283 vulnerability impacts both the 22.x and 9.x versions of Connect Secure, althought the 9.x branch, which reached end-of-life on Dec. 31, will not receive a patch. The CVE-2025-0282 flaw impacts only the 22.x branch.\n\n\n\n“Threat actor activity was identified by the Integrity Checker Tool (ICT) on the same day it occurred, enabling Ivanti to respond promptly and rapidly develop a fix,” the company said in a blog post. “We continue to work closely with affected customers, external security partners, and law enforcement agencies as we respond to this threat. We strongly advise all customers to closely monitor their internal and external ICT as a part of a robust and layered approach to cybersecurity to ensure the integrity and security of the entire network infrastructure.”\n\n\n\nThe company credits Google’s Mandiant and Microsoft’s Threat Intelligence Center (MSTIC) for collaborating in the response, so it’s possible more details about the attacks that exploited the vulnerability will be released at a later date by these companies as has happened in the past.\n\n\n\nThis is just the latest of several vulnerabilities in Ivanti products exploited in the wild as zero days by APT groups over the past year. In February 2024, the US government went so far as to order agencies to take Ivanti VPNs offline.\n\n\n\nThe company has not publicly released indicators of compromise observed for this latest exploit but said such information will be shared on request with customers that have confirmed impact with the ICT scans.",

      "contentSnippet": "The International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) on Tuesday said that it is “actively investigating reports of a potential information security incident allegedly linked to a threat actor known for targeting international organizations,” and has initially concluded that “approximately 42,000 recruitment application data records from April 2016 to July 2024” were stolen.\n\n\n\nIn its initial statement, the ICAO said, “We can confirm that this incident is limited to the recruitment database and does not affect any systems related to aviation safety or security operations.”\n\n\n\nOn Wednesday, ICAO officials elaborated on that statement during an email exchange between CSO Online and ICAO communications officer William Raillant-Clark, who said, “ICAO began its probe as soon as the claims were brought to our attention” on January 5, 2025.\n\n\n\nBut even if the systems impacting security were not directly affected, the information stolen could be used by attackers to impersonate airline officials with access to sensitive areas, according to Johannes Ullrich, the dean of research at the SANS Institute, which provides cybersecurity certifications and research.\n\n\n\n“It’s very risky” because “we don’t know how [the attackers] are going to use the data that they now control. They could apply to jobs with that information,” Ullrich said. “If they have the information from a solid job application and they can impersonate them, it could place them in places of trust. It might be in backend systems that exchange flight data and such, potentially disrupting air travel.”\n\n\n\nWhen asked how ICAO can say that the flight systems are not endangered by the breach, Raillant-Clark said that his agency can’t predict what the attackers will do with the stolen data. \n\n\n\nHe said, “we are not in a position to validate claims or other statements made by external parties, and nor are we in a position to speculate on their intent.”\n\n\n\nThe agency said that the data was “claimed to be released by the threat actor known as Natohub.”\n\n\n\nReports have identified Natohub as the alias a data thief uses on BreachForum, a cyberthief forum and marketplace.  \n\n\n\nWithout getting specific, ICAO said, “we have implemented additional security measures to protect our systems. We are also working to identify and notify affected individuals.”\n\n\n\nExtensive data stolen\n\n\n\n“The compromised data includes recruitment-related information that applicants entered into our system, such as names, email addresses, dates of birth, and employment history,” the initial ICAO statement said. “The affected data does not include financial information, passwords, passport details, or any documents uploaded by applicants.”\n\n\n\nThere have been many reports of attacks on job application databases because they tend to have massive amounts of personally identifiable information (PII) and other sensitive information. \n\n\n\nAdding to the cybersecurity problem is the fact that many enterprises tend to outsource these sites to third parties who may not have the most robust protections.\n\n\n\nOne of the weaknesses in job application systems is the ability for applicants to upload files. “Allowing uploading of files, especially PDFs, is one of the most dangerous things a system can allow,”  Ullrich said, noting it could let attackers upload malware.\n\n\n\n“These employment application databases are always targets because they have a lot of information” and many companies “collect more data than they really need,” he said. \n\n\n\nFor example, Ullrich pointed to the ICAO statement that dates of birth were stolen. “Do they really need to ask that that early in the process?”\n\n\n\n“I hope that they have strong evidence that it was not leaked,” he said, adding that the best tactics to protect such information is to encrypt as much data as possible and implement an automated mechanism to move data off of a public environment into a closed secure environment as quickly as possible. \n\n\n\nUllrich also questioned the portion of the ICAO statement that detailed what had not been stolen. Given that breach reports are routinely updated and expanded, it’s much safer to say what was definitely stolen and not discuss what initially appears to have not been stolen.\n\n\n\nCombatting these issues requires sophisticated, experienced cybersecurity talent, which “you often don’t find in these outsourced vendors” handling job application functions, Ullrich said. \n\n\n\nGiven that the data grabbed spanned more than eight years, it seems likely that it was stored for an extensive period. \n\n\n\nHe also questioned whether the attacker had actually targeted the UN agency, or whether it was just an attack of opportunity, where the attacker found holes in the third-party job application firm’s platform and was systematically going after all of its customers. \n\n\n\nThe attacker might be just “taking out sites created by this vendor,” Ullrich said. “It’s very possible that [ICAO] was not targeted, and was just caught because of someone fishing for sites with a particular vulnerability.”",

      "contentSnippet": "The following article discusses adult themes.\nThere was a legend in my high school about turning your PlayStation 2 into an ersatz vibrator by creating a custom skate park in Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3. Build a circular grind rail, turn off the ability to fall, jump on it and your DualShock would launch into a never ending frenzy of haptic feedback. It’s an idea the team at Motorbunny is taking to its logical conclusion, adding a wireless controller for its eponymous ride on sex toy that can connect to a DualSense controller. Its pitch is that you’ll be able to combine getting your game on with getting off. And yes, I am ashamed for writing that sentence.\nThe company was at CES 2025 in Las Vegas, Nevada, showing off PlayMate, its wireless dongle that can control the beefy saddle-style toy. In its demo, the PlayMate was plugged into the USB-C port on the back of a DualSense controlling a PS5 playing Rocket League. Except there’s no way to pull the haptics data from the DualSense, or any other gaming handset, for that matter. Instead, it has a built-in gyroscope that will track how aggressively you pitch and tilt your controller, and uses that information to control the Motorbunny. This isn’t as good as the Tony Hawk plan from 2001, but will at least enable some folks to merge both of their hobbies at the same time.\nPlayMate is one of a suite of products the company is releasing, including a series of less expensive vibes under the Fluffer label. This is a sub-brand designed to tie in the worlds of gaming and sex, with the app even having some arcade games that you can use to control your toys. In one demo, there was a Flappy Bird clone that would increase the intensity of the vibration the longer you were able to keep the bird in the air. Sadly the company wasn’t ready to share details of pricing and availability just yet, but said a whole host of products would be hitting the market in the following months.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/gaming/motorbunnys-playmate-lets-your-console-kinda-control-your-vibe-233001475.html?src=rss",

      "title": "CES 2025: LG smart appliances wrap-up",
      "link": "https://www.techhive.com/article/2572100/ces-2025-lg-smart-appliances-wrap-up.html",
      "contentSnippet": "Visitors to the Home Appliances wing of LG Electronics’ vast CES 2025 exhibit will likely be drawn first to the most visually enticing new products: a breakthrough LG Signature Microwave oven, redesigned indoor gardening appliances, and a hyper helpful robot that couldn’t be cuter.  Stuff that makes for cheery Eyewitness TV news coverage and social influencer posts from the giant tech show.\n\n\n\nBut sorry, gang, you’ll really be missing something important if you don’t also pay attention to the modest looking cylindrical object plotzed on an LG booth table. While the LG ThinQ ON home hub is intentionally muted in appearance to blend in with any space and décor, it’s the AI-enhanced, smart home assistant that could prove the most helpful to your home life.\n\n\n\nWhat’s so hot about a Microwave?\n\n\n\n“Not much has changed in microwaves through the years,” noted my seasoned tour guide John I. Taylor, Senior VP of LG Electronics USA, Inc. But the times they are a-changing with the LG Signature Over-the-Range Microwave, which not only excels in cooking and heating food but also delivers an immersive entertainment experience.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tLG Electronics\n\n\n\nOn command, the glass front of the microwave’s door reveals itself to be a 27-inch wide Full HD (1080P) touchscreen display with a variety of uses. Activating “InstaView” triggers three inside cameras to offer real-time cook monitoring and time-lapse image creation (great fodder for food bloggers.) And should you pair this microwave with the new, likewise camera-fitted LG Signature Slide-in Double Range, that microwave screen can also keep you in the know as things are cooking down below, without the need to stoop or open an oven door.\n\n\n\nBut wait, there’s more. The 27-inch screen also comes with built-in speakers and Wi-Fi connectivity, to bring a variety of entertainment content to the kitchen whilst you’re cooking or eating. The screen likewise offers access to the LG ThinQ Smart Home Dashboard, becoming an oversized smart pad to control all your LG AI appliances and compatible Matter and Thread devices.\n\n\n\nMore kitchen kapers\n\n\n\nWhile we’re in the foodie zone, pay attention to the new 36-inch Smart InstaView French Door Refrigerator. Its upgraded, fully transparent T-OLED display embedded in the upper right door functions as both a digital touch interface and a Dual InstaView panel to show what’s inside the fridge without opening the door and letting the chill out.\n\n\n\nOn the kinda wild and weird side, Hologram like visuals can also be activated on said screen, blending the virtual with the real, while music plays from your curated playlist. That refrigerator’s inside camera functions pragmatically, too, with LG’s ThinQ Food management system to automatically recognize stored food items, suggest “will-work-with-that-stuff“recipes and warn when favored items are running low or about to expire.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tLG Electronics\n\n\n\nUpgraded proximity sensors are at play in the sleek LG Signature Dishwasher, with a handle that sits flush with the door when not in use then automatically pops out when a hand approaches. And on the laundry front, LG ‘s top washer is exploiting AI DD—Artificial Intelligence Direct Drive 2.0—to recognize and optimize fabric care settings. It’s spooky smart.\n\n\n\nHow does your apartment garden grow?\n\n\n\nBoth functional and decorative, LG’s new-gen, indoor gardening appliances merge an advanced growing system with a spiffy look. Downward-facing lights support optimal plant growth during the day while upward-facing mood lighting illuminates the crop and creates a calming ambiance in the evening.\n\n\n\nThese mini arborteums have smarts, of course, automatically dispensing the right amount of water (from a 1.5 gallon tank) and nutrients to care for the specific number and variety of plants being grown, even when users are away for extended periods (up to a week.) Forthcoming in both a floor lamp standing model and in a side table styled design, users can use the companion ThinQ app to control the lighting settings, monitor growth, and manage cultivation schedules from across the room or halfway around the world.\n\n\n\nSay hey, hubbie\n\n\n\nLG has coined its deployments of AI as “Affectionate Intelligence.” And nowhere is that more evident than in its (tentatively named) Q9 Self-Driving AI Home Hub: a home agent that moves freely around the premises, interacts with the residents and recognizes situations and context to trigger appropriate actions of ThinQ connected appliances.\n\n\n\nLG touts this two-wheeled bot as “the first product to realize the concept of providing ‘care services’ in the smart home domain by actively controlling appliances, saving energy, and offering care through a combination of IoT, appliance data, user conversation context, and lifestyle patterns. “\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tLG Electronics\n\n\n\nIf Q9 sees the cat knock over its food bowl, the hub will send a message to your robot vac to clean up the mess. And when it hears “It’s kinda chilly in here,” it’ll tell your smart thermostat to crank up the furnace or heat pump. And if you slip and fall and can’t up, you could ask it to summon help.\n\n\n\nLG’s John Taylor is most taken by this companion device’s charming ability to concoct a story from drawings and/or to read a book out loud .“You just put the page or image in front of the camera at the top of the display, and it will extract the text or dream up a story  from the drawing, then voice and act it out with various expressions and motions.“ While LG is touting this AI skill as primarily for children, the LG exec thinks “it could also be quite helpful for any one with impaired vision.”\n\n\n\nAlso coming to everyone’s rescue—Q9 will provide GPT-4o-generated answers to questions practical, mundane, or far-fetched without ever complaining “stop pestering me.”\n\n\n\nSaving the best for last\n\n\n\nWhile the maker might wish you would only buy LG appliances that are remotely controllable via its ThinQ OS and app, they’re cognizant that users have also invested in appliances and Internet of Things (IoT) devices operating on a variety of other platforms. To serve as a peace maker, help them all work and cooperate from a single app, it’s soon to bring us ThinQ ON, a smart home hub product that applies generative AI to the task of home management.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tLG Electronics\n\n\n\nThinQ On is largely based on the Homey Pro smart hub from Athom, a Dutch company that LG took a majority interest in (an 80 percent stake) in July, 2024. More than a decade in development, the current Homey Pro can connect to more than 50,000 devices, load up with apps from an options list numbering near 1,000, including standard protocols such as Matter, Thread, and Zigbee; plus, connection methods defined separately by each manufacturer. Adding disparate products and platforms via an on-screen menu is reportedly straightforward and easy, according to most reviewers.\n\n\n\nOne differentiator from Homey: the ThinQ On hub will offer onboard voice activation with that Affectionate Intelligence:“Our secret sauce,” says Taylor. Operation entails using a large language model and the ThinQ platform to understand the user’s context, enabling natural conversation for the operation of home appliances and home IoT devices. It identifies the users’ intention, suggests routines appropriate to the situation and can juggle multiple issues when necessary.\n\n\n\nAsk it to start the washing machine, unaware that the detergent dispenser is empty, and ThinQ On will first alert you of that situation and hold off starting the cycle until the dispenser has been filled. If it knows (from a connected smart watch) that you were exercising earlier the same day, it will pre-set the wash cycle for “active wear.”\n\n\n\nThe beauty of this computerized hub is that it functions locally, independent of the internet except for software loading/updating. Local control delivers enhanced privacy, and eliminates dependence on your home’s connection to the internet. That’s quite from the cloud-based, cross-platform schema in development by the Home Connectivity Alliance, an organization similarly “dedicated to the development and promotion of safe and secure interoperability across long-life appliances, HVAC systems and TVs within the connected home ecosystem.” LG is a member of that alliance, which was supposed to deliver the goods by the end of 2024. But you what happens to the best-laid plans.\n\n\n\nAlso prepped to offer smart speaker entertainment thrills (music, news, and weather on demand) , the ThinQ On hub will first appear for sale later this year in Korea, LG’s home territory and primo R&D stomping ground, we’re told. Same goes for the Q9 Self-Driving AI Home Hub.\n\n\n\nThose new kitchen and laundry appliances should all be circling the globe in due course in 2025.\n\n\n\nPrices have yet to be announced on any of the products but for the smart hub curious, we can take some guidance from the current $399 price tag on the Homey Pro and the $199 asking price for the soon-to-come, less-powerful Homey Pro mini.  ",

      "contentSnippet": "A release from the Assa Abloy Group, the Stockholm-based multinational door and access conglomerate that owns trusted identity firm HID Global, says it is acquiring the linked access control firms 3millID Corporation and Third Millennium Systems Ltd.\r\n\r\nThe two firms operate in the U.S. and UK, respectively, but have a commercial partnership that dates back to 2015. 3millID is based in Colorado and provides proprietary access control readers and credential related products for the North American enterprise market. Third Millennium is based in Wales and provides biometric access control software for enterprise and government in the UK and Europe.\r\n\r\nNico Delvaux, President and CEO of Assa Abloy, says the companies, which will be integrated into the Physical Access Control Solutions Business Area of HID, bring “exciting technological additions that will reinforce our current offering within physical access control, and provide complementary growth opportunities.”\r\n\r\n\"Welcoming 3millID and Third Millennium into the HID family demonstrates our continued investment in core physical access control technologies,” says Björn Lidefelt, EVP of HID. “These acquisitions bring new opportunities to increase customer choice and relevance within our portfolio and will enhance our presence outside of the United States.”\r\n\r\nThe two acquired companies combined for $21 million in sales with a positive EBITDA margin in 2023, according to the announcement.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions and is expected to close in Q1 2025.\r\n\r\nAssa Abloy has been merrily acquiring companies as of late. In December alone, it scooped up U.S. security hardware manufacturer Norshield Security Products; Polish access control systems manufacturer Roger; 9Solutions, a Finnish provider of AI tools for healthcare; and Louisiana’s Premier Steel Doors and Frames.",

      "contentSnippet": "Speculation over how incoming U.S. President Donald Trump plans to harden the country’s borders and carry out mass deportations, the place of biometrics in border control programs and the budgets those programs will have has reached a fever pitch.\r\n\r\nThe Trump campaign was heavily focused on increasing border control and promises to deport illegal immigrants, both of which would entail identifying people who are crossing or have crossed the border. Civil society groups and media outlets warn that these efforts have warned that “techno-solutionism” applied to immigration could easily be turned against Americans.\r\n\r\nPresident-elect Trump told NBC News in the wake of the election that his deportation plan would have \"no price tag.\" And Thomson Reuters notes that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) issued an RFI for GPS tracking and biometric monitoring devices the day after the election.\r\n\r\nAn opinion piece published by The Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists points out that shares in GEO Group, a prison company whose subsidiary BI Inc. manages the SmartLINK facial recognition app through which ICE monitors migrants, jumped by 73 percent following the election.\r\n\r\nBut as many observers have noted, biometrics contracts with ICE have also expanded under the outgoing Democratic Party Administration.\r\n\r\nChanges and more restrictive border policies are being planned, however.\r\n\r\nRepublican lawmakers including House Speaker Mike Johnson have said that the preferred approach to the legislative changes needed to enact the President’s desired policies at the border and elsewhere is the passage of a single, comprehensive bill. The bill would be voted on through a “reconciliation” process, allowing a simple Senate majority of 50 votes for approval instead of the 60 normally required under a filibuster rule, The Guardian reports.\r\n\r\nPresident Trump is even taking credit for Canadian investments in drones and helicopters for border security.",

      "contentSnippet": "“You are now entering a safety zone,” says a voice over the loudspeaker, as Arnold Schwarzenegger strides toward an X-ray body scanner deployed at a border checkpoint on Mars. “No unauthorized weapons allowed beyond this point.” When Arnold and his compatriots walk through the corridor, their scanned bone biometrics show up as green skeletons behind a black screen.\r\n\r\nThe scene is from the 1990 science fiction film Total Recall. While the airports of 2025 are not yet equipped with breeze-through visual scanners like this, new developments in biometric scanning technology are getting us close. In 2024, for the first time, the TSA screened more than three million people in a single day, as travelers made their way home after Thanksgiving.\r\n\r\nThat crunch led to delays, cancellations and suspensions – underlining the need for more efficient passenger processing to accommodate passenger numbers that continue to climb.\r\nLeidos extends ongoing contract with TSA for IT, logistics\r\nAn article published on the website of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security explores how the Science and Technology Directorate (S&T) and Transportation Security Administration (TSA) are collaborating on tech to “reimagine imaging at the airport.”\r\n\r\nKey to the plan is the TSA’s relationship with Leidos. The Virginia-based biometrics firm traces its incumbency as a main provider of IT and logistics services to the TSA in support of airport screening equipment back to 2013.\r\n\r\nAccording to Washington Technology, it has now won a potential seven-year, $2.6 billion contract to continue its role in the Integrated Logistics Support program, which oversees passenger and baggage screening equipment at 448 domestic airports in the U.S.\r\n\r\nLeidos won the prior recompete bid in 2019 at a $926.5 million ceiling, now increased to $1 billion.\r\nTech for S&T Screening at Speed Program uses non-harmful radio waves\r\nFor S&T, the objective is captured in its Screening at Speed Program, which uses high definition imaging to expedite the screening process.\r\n\r\n“The Screening at Speed Program is working with the Department of Energy’s Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) to develop improved detection capabilities and a more user-friendly passenger experience,” says the piece. “High Definition-Advanced Imaging Technology (HD-AIT) is the backbone of this development.”\r\n\r\nThe proffered description of HD-AIT locates it not far from Arnold’s sci-fi tunnel. The tech “uses non-harmful radio waves known as millimeter waves that pass through natural and synthetic materials to generate high-resolution data,” the article says.\r\n\r\n“Millimeter waves can penetrate through fabrics to screen for concealed objects, including non-metallic objects that traditional metal detectors aren’t designed to detect. However, the millimeter waves are completely safe as they are 10,000 times less powerful than cell phone signals and don’t penetrate the skin.”\r\n\r\nThe data is “processed by an algorithm that protects passenger privacy and provides results on a generic representative human figure for Transportation Security Officers (TSOs) to review.” Human officers will conduct secondary screening as needed.\r\nThrough the screening glass: Real-Time AIT\r\nFor now, the stated benefits of HD-AIT deployments – available in standalone or retrofit prototype versions – are improved detection and better passenger experience, in that passengers could be allowed to keep on light jackets, sweaters and shoes during screening. Augmentations like a dedicated shoe scanner (rumored to be on display at CES in Las Vegas) show the potential for further improvement.\r\n\r\nWhile a trip to Mars is still out of scope, “Real-Time Advanced Imaging Technology builds upon the HD-AIT technology, increases its capability, and places it inside modular panel sensors to collect images at video rates as passengers walk-by or move in front of the panels.”\r\n\r\nThe more forward leaning Real-Time AIT “may eventually allow standard passengers to be screened at walking speeds, similar to a metal detector.”\r\n\r\nIn other words, a Total Recall total recall.\r\nWest Virginia mobile driver’s licenses now on TSA\r\nIn more pedestrian news on digital ID for travel, TSA checkpoints with digital ID readers nationwide are now accepting mobile driver licenses (mDLs) issued by West Virginia.\r\n\r\nA release says travelers who have downloaded the West Virginia Mobile ID app to their phone can use it for identity verification during the screening process. The app is free for all state residents, and is provided by Idemia Public Security North America.\r\n\r\nWest Virginia is the fourteenth state to offer digital IDs compatible with TSA’s credential authentication technology. Other states offering TSA-approved mDLs are Arizona, California, Colorado, Georgia, Hawaii, Iowa, Louisiana, Maryland, New Mexico, New York, Ohio, Puerto Rico and Utah.\r\n\r\nThe TSA website has a map of airports that accept digital ID credentials.",

      "link": "https://www.csoonline.com/article/3635417/dna-sequencer-vulnerabilities-signal-firmware-issues-across-medical-device-industry.html",
      "contentSnippet": "In highlighting vulnerabilities in a widely used DNA gene sequencing device, security researchers have brought further attention to the likely poor state of security in the medical device industry, where hardware and firmware development is often outsourced to external equipment manufacturers under questionable support contracts.\n\n\n\nThe device, Illumina’s iSeq 100 compact DNA sequencer, is used by medical laboratories around the world for a wide range of applications. When investigating the device, researchers from supply chain security firm Eclypsium discovered vulnerabilities at the firmware level, as well as key missing security features designed to prevent malicious firmware implants.\n\n\n\n“We found that the Illumina iSeq 100 used a very outdated implementation of BIOS firmware using CSM mode and without Secure Boot or standard firmware write protections,” the researchers wrote in a report. “This would allow an attacker on the system to overwrite the system firmware to either ‘brick’ the device or install a firmware implant for ongoing attacker persistence.”\n\n\n\nBut the nature of the development process typical for such devices suggests many other medical devices may be at risk of the same or similar issues — problems that often arise in the IoT and embedded device space, medical or otherwise.\n\n\n\nA typical x86 computer — with typical legacy tech problems\n\n\n\nAside from its custom case, touchscreen interface, and other custom peripherals used for DNA sequencing, the iSeq 100 isn’t very different from a typical x86 desktop PC. Its base hardware consists of an Intel Celeron J1900 2GHz Quad Core CPU, 8GB RAM, and 240GB SSD running Windows 10 loT Enterprise.\n\n\n\nThat’s not surprising given that Illumina, like many medical device vendors, outsourced the hardware design and manufacturing to an original design manufacturer (ODM) — in this case IEI Integration, which develops a wide range of industrial and medical computer products. IEI manufactured the motherboard inside the iSeq 100 and it is the supplier of the Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) firmware that powers the device.\n\n\n\nUEFI is a standardized specification for firmware in computer systems — the modern equivalent to BIOS — and includes the low-level code responsible for initializing a computer’s hardware before loading the operating system installed on the hard drive.\n\n\n\nAccording to Eclypsium’s researchers, the firmware inside the iSeq 100 (B480AM12 – 04/12/2018) was released in 2018 and has known vulnerabilities. Computer and device manufacturers use UEFI implementations developed by a handful of independent BIOS vendors (IBVs) that they then configure and customize with their own code.\n\n\n\nA vulnerability in the base UEFI implementation from an IBV is likely to impact products from all manufacturers that use that IBV’s firmware. For example, one attack dubbed LogoFAIL, discovered in 2023, affected base UEFI implementations from all three major IBVs — Insyde, AMI, and Phoenix — due to multiple vulnerabilities in their image parsing code.\n\n\n\nAs a result, most PC manufacturers had to release BIOS/UEFI updates, but many older PCs and motherboards have remained vulnerable in perpetuity because PC manufacturers offer software support only for a few years despite those products being used in the real world for much longer.\n\n\n\nThat problem is even worse in the IoT and embedded device space, where specialized real-time operating systems (RTOSes) are common. Firmware components such as TCP/IP stacks originally developed decades ago by software companies that no longer exist or whose intellectual property changed hands more than once over the years are often found in these devices.\n\n\n\nIndustrial hardware supply chains are impacted by this issue as well, making firmware security a difficult problem to tackle for end users if no firmware updates are provided. LogoFAIL is one of the vulnerabilities Eclypsium detected in iSeq 100’s outdated firmware, along with other issues such as the absence of firmware write protections, Secure Boot not being enabled, and the OS booting in Compatibility Support Mode (CSM).\n\n\n\nThe CPU microcode, typically included in UEFI, was also outdated and vulnerable to known side-channel data leak vulnerabilities impacting Intel CPUs such as Spectre v2 (Branch Target Injection) and Fallout and RIDL (Microarchitectural Data Sampling).\n\n\n\n“Illumina appreciates Eclypsium Research’s report and our shared commitment to the Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure principles,” an Illumina spokesperson told CSO via email. “We are following our standard processes and will notify impacted customers if any mitigations are required. Our initial evaluation indicates these issues are not high-risk.”\n\n\n\nThe spokesperson continued: “Illumina is committed to the security of our products and to privacy of genomic data and we have established oversight and accountability processes, including security best practices for the development and deployment of our products. As part of this commitment, we are always working to improve how we deliver security updates for instruments in the field.”\n\n\n\nFirmware protections needed to prevent UEFI implants\n\n\n\nSince firmware flashing is not blocked and the firmware is missing write protections for critical regions, attackers with local administrator access on the OS could easily inject malicious code into the firmware or rewrite it entirely, rendering the device inoperable.\n\n\n\n“This is not a far-fetched scenario given that the Illumina sequencers were recently found to have a critical RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerability (CVE-2023-1968),” the Eclypsium researchers wrote in their report. “The issue affected a variety of Illumina devices, resulting in an FDA Class II recall as well as an ICS Medical Advisory from CISA.”\n\n\n\nThat 2023 RCE vulnerability has since been patched, but attackers could find another vulnerability or steal credentials for the device and exploit a privilege escalation flaw in Windows, which are common. The Illumina sequencer runs Windows 10 2016 LTSB, Version 1607, for which mainstream support ended in October 2021, but the extended support option will continue until October 2026.\n\n\n\nThe fact that Secure Boot is not enabled means the code responsible for booting the operating system, both at the UEFI level and the Windows bootloader itself, are not cryptographically verified. As such, malicious code could be injected into the boot process to take control of the OS kernel, a malware attack known as a bootkit (boot rootkit).\n\n\n\nUEFI bootkits have been used in the wild for over a decade. Examples include LoJax (2018), MosaicRegressor (2020), FinSpy (2021), ESPecter (2021), MoonBounce (2022), CosmicStrand (2022), and BlackLotus (2023).\n\n\n\nSign of a broader issue\n\n\n\nWhile Eclypsium’s research looked only at the Illumina iSeq 100, the researchers believe many medical devices likely suffer from similar firmware security issues inherited from the hardware supply chain. Medical device vendors don’t always manufacture their device hardware themselves, instead focusing on their core area of expertise and outsourcing the rest of the device development process to ODMs and IBVs, for example.\n\n\n\n“It is more than likely that the same process is utilized by many other manufacturers,” Alex Bazhaniuk, CTO of Eclypsium, told CSO. “Once a medical device manufacturer enters the R&D phase, they go ‘shopping’ at ODMs and IBVs for hardware and firmware solutions to accelerate their time to market. This process is treated like any other product transaction where the manufacturer gets offered a quote for the [hardware/firmware] and support for X years — sometimes this includes security updates at no cost and sometimes it does not.”\n\n\n\n“From what we have seen, ODMs and even IBVs will provide updates up to a certain point, but once the device passes a certain age, it is much harder to issue fixes or even generate code for the fixes to begin with,” he said. “Keep in mind that industrial computer boards are designed to operate for much longer than regular computing boards we are familiar with.”",

Any public sector organization can start today to assess and gather resources, cultivate internal buy-in, and lay the groundwork for effective deployments of GenAI.”\r\n\r\n“The release of this playbook marks a significant step forward in our efforts to integrate safe and secure AI use responsibly and effectively within the public sector,” said DHS Chief Information Officer Eric Hysen. “By sharing our experiences and best practices, we aim to empower other government agencies to leverage AI in a way that enhances their missions while safeguarding the rights and privacy of the individuals they serve.”\r\n\r\nDHS said that “the rapid advancement and commercialization of GenAI presents both significant opportunities and challenges for [DHS] and public sector organizations at all levels,” and noted that “in alignment with Executive Order 14110, which emphasizes the responsible deployment of AI technologies, [it] has proactively initiated GenAI pilot programs to explore their potential in enhancing our mission capabilities.”\r\n\r\n“These pilot initiatives have provided valuable insights into the practical applications of GenAI within our operations,” DHS says, and “have underscored the importance of a measured and thoughtful approach to AI integration, ensuring that our deployments are responsible, trustworthy, and effective while protecting privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties.”\r\n\r\nEarlier this year, DHS released an Artificial Intelligence Roadmap describing its plans to guide its responsible use of AI while ensuring individuals’ privacy rights, civil rights, and civil liberties are protected.\r\n\r\nOne of the playbook’s central themes is safeguarding individual privacy during GenAI deployment. DHS emphasizes stringent controls over the handling of sensitive data, particularly in scenarios where GenAI interfaces with public or personal information. To mitigate risks, DHS requires clear guidelines that define what data can be shared with GenAI systems and restricts unauthorized use.\r\n\r\nPrivacy Impact Assessments are integral to this framework, ensuring that all uses of GenAI comply with federal privacy laws and regulations, DHS said. Furthermore, the playbook mandates human oversight in evaluating GenAI outputs, reinforcing the principle that these tools must supplement human decision-making rather than replacing it entirely. By embedding privacy professionals into pilot Integrated Project Teams, DHS sys it has created a culture of proactive privacy management that minimizes risks such as data breaches or inadvertent exposure of sensitive information.\r\n\r\nThe playbook also underscores the necessity of robust cybersecurity measures when implementing GenAI systems. Recognizing the potential vulnerabilities inherent in AI systems, DHS developed security guidelines tailored for critical infrastructure and public sector applications. These measures include comprehensive risk assessments, system testing for adversarial robustness, and stringent compliance with existing cybersecurity protocols.\r\n\r\nGenAI deployments must be integrated into secure IT environments, which often require custom configurations or the use of specialized models such as open-weight AI systems for offline operations. DHS says this adaptability is particularly crucial for sensitive applications such as law enforcement investigations or immigration services where data security is paramount. The playbook also advises continuous monitoring of GenAI tools to enable early detection and mitigation of security threats.\r\n\r\nEnsuring the ethical application of GenAI is a cornerstone of DHS’s framework. The playbook repeatedly stresses the importance of aligning AI use with constitutional rights, civil liberties, and anti-discrimination laws. GenAI must not perpetuate or exacerbate biases, whether in training data or its outputs. This principle is critical in areas like immigration processing, where any algorithmic bias could have significant consequences for individuals.\r\n\r\nTo safeguard civil rights, DHS says it has embedded oversight professionals -including civil liberties experts - into every stage of the pilot process. This collaborative approach allows for the real-time identification of risks and the implementation of corrective actions, fostering trust in GenAI systems. For example, the requirement for transparency and explainability in GenAI tools ensures that all stakeholders, including the public, can understand how decisions are made.\r\n\r\nTransparency is pivotal in building trust in GenAI deployments. DHS says it has committed to openly sharing non-sensitive uses of GenAI through its AI Use Case Inventory, a resource designed to inform the public and other stakeholders about the applications of AI across the department. This initiative aligns with broader government mandates for accountability in AI systems.\r\n\r\nThe playbook also emphasizes the importance of iterative feedback and usability testing to refine GenAI tools. Stakeholder engagement, both internal and external, is a recurring theme. By soliciting input from users, oversight bodies, and the public, DHS says its has created mechanisms to enhance system transparency and usability while addressing emerging concerns.\r\n\r\nWhile not a primary focus, the playbook additionally addresses online authentication challenges within GenAI deployment. Ensuring that users and systems interacting with GenAI are properly authenticated is a fundamental security measure. DHS proposes integrating GenAI with existing authentication frameworks, such as multi-factor authentication and digital identity verification, to bolster system integrity. These safeguards are particularly important in applications involving access to confidential data or high-stakes decision-making environments.\r\n\r\nThe playbook defines responsible GenAI use as aligning AI systems with democratic values and societal goals. Trustworthiness is achieved through characteristics such as reliability, safety, transparency, and fairness. To operationalize these principles, DHS has established comprehensive guidelines for evaluating GenAI systems, including their accuracy, interpretability, and potential impacts on civil rights.\r\n\r\nDHS has also developed training programs to ensure employees are well-versed in the capabilities and limitations of GenAI. These programs aim to instill a shared understanding of responsible AI practices across the DHS enterprise. This approach not only mitigates risks, but it also fosters a culture of ethical innovation, DHS says.\r\n\r\nThe playbook also advocates for a structured governance model that incorporates diverse stakeholders, from technical experts to civil liberties professionals. By building cross-functional teams, DHS says it has ensured that GenAI deployments benefit from a broad spectrum of expertise and perspectives. Governance structures also provide a framework for addressing the ethical, legal, and operational challenges posed by GenAI.\r\n\r\nThe DHS Playbook for Public Sector GenAI Deployment represents a critical step forward in integrating AI responsibly into government operations. By addressing privacy, security, civil rights, transparency, and online authentication, the framework ensures that GenAI deployments are both effective and aligned with societal values.\r\n\r\nThe playbook’s holistic approach not only mitigates risks but also sets a standard for how public sector organizations can harness the transformative potential of AI responsibly and ethically. As DHS continues to refine its strategies, its playbook serves as a foundational guide for advancing trustworthy AI in service of the public good.",

      "title": "Tragedy Spurred the First Effective Land-Mine Detector",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/mine-detector",
      "contentSnippet": "Land mines have been around in one form or another for more than a thousand years. By now, you’d think a simple and safe way of locating and removing the devices would’ve been engineered. But that’s not the case. In fact, up until World War II, the most common method for finding the explosives was to prod the ground with a pointed stick or bayonet. The hockey-puck-size devices were buried about 15 centimeters below the ground. When someone stepped on the ground above or near the mine, their weight triggered a pressure sensor and caused the device to explode. So mine clearing was nearly as dangerous as just walking through a minefield unawares.During World War II, land mines were widely used by both Axis and Allied forces and were responsible for the deaths of 375,000 soldiers, according to the Warfare History Network.In 1941 Józef Stanislaw Kosacki, a Polish signals officer who had escaped to the United Kingdom, developed the first portable device to effectively detect a land mine without inadvertently triggering it. It proved to be twice as fast as previous mine-detection methods, and was soon in wide use by the British and their allies.The Engineer Behind the Portable Mine DetectorBefore inventing his mine detector, Kosacki worked as an engineer and had developed tools to detect explosives for the Polish Armed Forces.After receiving a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Warsaw University of Technology in 1933, Kosacki completed his year-long mandatory service with the army. He then joined the National Telecommunications Institute in Warsaw as a manager. Then, as now, the agency led the country’s R&D in telecommunications and information technologies. In 1937 Kosacki was commissioned by the Polish Ministry of National Defence to develop a machine that could detect unexploded grenades and shells. He completed his machine, but it was never used in the field.\n\nPolish engineer Józef Kosacki’s portable land-mine detector saved thousands of soldiers’ lives in World War II. Military Historical OfficeWhen Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, Kosacki returned to active duty. Because of his background in electrical engineering, he was placed in a special communications unit that was responsible for the upkeep of the Warszawa II radio station. But that duty lasted only until the radio towers were destroyed by the German Army a month after the invasion.With Warsaw under German occupation, Kosacki and his unit were captured and taken to an internment camp in Hungary. In December 1939, he escaped and eventually found his way to the United Kingdom. There he joined other Polish soldiers in the 1st Polish Army Corps, stationed in St. Andrews, Scotland. He trained soldiers in the use of wireless telegraphy to send messages in Morse code.Then tragedy struck.Tragedy Inspired Engineering Ingenuity The invention of the portable mine detector came about after a terrible accident on the beaches of Dundee, Scotland. In 1940, the British Army, fearing a German invasion, buried thousands of land mines along the coast. But they didn’t notify their allies. Soldiers from the Polish 10th Armored Cavalry Brigade on a routine patrol of the beach were killed or injured when the land mines exploded. This event prompted the British Army to launch a contest to develop an effective land-mine detector. Each entrant had to pass a simple test: Detect a handful of coins scattered on the beach. Kosacki and his assistant spent three months refining Kosacki’s earlier grenade detector. During the competition, their new detector located all of the coins, beating the other six devices entered.There’s some murkiness about the detector’s exact circuitry, as befits a technology developed under wartime security, but our best understanding is this: The tool consisted of a bamboo pole with an oval-shaped wooden panel at one end that held two coils—one transmitting and one receiving, according to a 2015 article in Aerospace Research in Bulgaria. The soldier held the detector by the pole and passed the wooden panel over the ground. A wooden backpack encased a battery unit, an acoustic-frequency oscillator, and an amplifier. The transmitting coil was connected to the oscillator, which generated current at an acoustic frequency, writes Mike Croll in his book The History of Landmines. The receiving coil was connected to the amplifier, which was then linked to a pair of headphones. \n\nThe detector weighed less than 14 kilograms and operated much like the metal detectors used by beachcombers today. Michał Bojara/National Museum of Technology in WarsawWhen the panel came close to a metallic object, the induction balance between the two coils was disturbed. Via the amplifier, the receiving coil sent an audio signal to the headphones, notifying the soldier of a potential land mine. The equipment weighed just under 14 kilograms and could be operated by one soldier, according to Croll. Kosacki didn’t patent his technology and instead gave the British Army access to the device’s schematics. The only recognition he received at the time was a letter from King George VI thanking him for his service. Detectors were quickly manufactured and shipped to North Africa, where German commander Erwin Rommel had ordered his troops to build a defensive network of land mines and barbed wire that he called the Devil’s Gardens. The minefields stretched from the Mediterranean in northern Egypt to the Qattara Depression in western Egypt and contained an estimated 16 million mines over 2,900 square kilometers.Kosacki’s detectors were first used in the Second Battle of El Alamein, in Egypt, in October and November of 1942. British soldiers used the device to scour the minefield for explosives. Scorpion tanks followed the soldiers; heavy chains mounted on the front flailed the ground and exploded the mines as the tank moved forward. Kosacki’s mine detector doubled the speed at which such heavily mined areas could be cleared, from 100 to 200 square meters an hour. By the end of the war, his invention had saved thousands of lives.\n\nKosacki’s land-mine detector was first used in Egypt, to help clear a massive minefield laid by the Germans. The basic technology continued to be used until 1991.National Army MuseumThe basic design with minor modifications continued to be used by Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States until the end of the First Gulf War in 1991. By then, engineers had developed more sensitive portable detectors, as well as remote-controlled mine-clearing systems. Kosacki wasn’t publicly recognized for his work until after World War II, to prevent retribution against his family in German-occupied Poland. When Kosacki returned to Poland after the war, he began teaching electrical engineering at the National Centre for Nuclear Research, in Otwock-Świerk. He was also a professor at what is now the Military University of Technology in Warsaw. He died in 1990. The prototype of Kosacki’s detector shown at top is housed at the museum of the Military Institute of Engineering Technology, in Wroclaw, Poland. Land Mines Are Still a Worldwide ProblemLand-mine detection has still not been perfected, and the explosive devices are still a huge problem worldwide. On average, one person is killed or injured by land mines and other explosive ordnance every hour, according to UNICEF. Today, it’s estimated that 60 countries are still contaminated by mines and unexploded ordnance.Although portable mine detectors continue to be used, drones have become another detection method. For example, they’ve been used in Ukraine by several humanitarian nonprofits, including the Norwegian People’s Aid and the HALO Trust.Nonprofit APOPO is taking a different approach: training rats to sniff out explosives. The APOPO HeroRATs, as they are called, only detect the scent of explosives and ignore scrap metal, according to the organization. A single HeroRAT can search an area the size of a tennis court in 30 minutes, instead of the four days it would take a human to do so. Part of a continuing series looking at historical artifacts that embrace the boundless potential of technology. An abridged version of this article appears in the January 2025 print issue as “The First Land-Mine Detector That Actually Worked.”References There are many well-known Polish scientists, such as Marie Curie, whose discoveries and research made history. As a first-generation Polish-American, I wanted to learn more about the engineering feats of unknown innovators in Poland. After scouring museum websites, I came across Józef Kosacki and his portable mine detector.To learn more about his life and work, I read excerpts of Przemyslaw Slowinski and Teresa Kowalik’s 2020 book, Królewski dar: Co Polska i Polacy dali światu (“Royal Gifts: What Poland and Poles Gave the World”).I also read several articles about Kosacki on both Polish and Scottish websites, including the Polish Press Agency, Wielka Historia (Great History), and Curious St. Andrews, which covers the history of the city.To learn more about the history of land mines, I read articles published by the nonprofit APOPO, the BBC, and the U.S. Army. APOPO researches, develops, and implements land-mine detection technology to clear minefields in Africa.",

      "title": "Ambitious Projects Could Reshape Geopolitics",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/geopolitics-and-technology",
      "contentSnippet": "Over the last year, Spectrum’s editors have noticed an emerging through line connecting several major stories: the centrality of technology to geopolitics. Last month, our cover story, done in partnership with Foreign Policy magazine, was on the future of submarine warfare. And last October, we focused on how sea drones could bolster Taiwan’s “silicon shield” strategy, which rests on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s domination of high-end chip manufacturing. So when I asked the curator of this issue, Senior Editor Samuel K. Moore, what he saw as the major theme as we head into 2025, I wasn’t surprised when he said, without hesitation, “geopolitics and technology.” In fact, the same day Sam and I spoke, I forwarded to Spectrum’s Glenn Zorpette a news item about China banning the export to the United States of gallium, germanium and antimony. China’s overwhelming command of rare earths like these is at the heart of Zorpette’s story in this issue. “Inside an American Rare Earth Boomtown” paints a vivid picture of how the United States is trying to nurture a domestic rare earth mining and processing industry. China, meanwhile, is itself looking to minimize its own dependence on imported uranium by building a thorium-based molten-salt reactor in the Gobi Desert. And tensions between China and Taiwan will undoubtedly be further stressed with the opening of TSMC’s first advanced wafer fab in the United States this year.The mitigation of climate change is another key area where politics informs tech advances. In “Startups Begin Geoengineering the Sea”, Senior Associate Editor Emily Waltz takes readers aboard a pair of barges anchored near the Port of Los Angeles. There, two companies, Captura and Equatic, are piloting marine carbon-capture systems to strip CO2 out of ocean water. Whether the results can be measured accurately enough to help companies and countries meet their carbon-reduction goals is an open question.One way for the international community to study the impacts of these efforts could be Deep’s Sentinel program, the first part of which will be completed this year. Our correspondent Liam Critchley, based in England, reports in “Making Humans Aquatic Again” that Deep, located in Bristol, is building a modular habitat that will let scientists live underwater for weeks at a time.Another geopolitical concern also lies at sea: the vulnerability of undersea fiber-optic cables, which carry an ever-growing share of the world’s Internet traffic. The possibility of outages due to attack or accident is so worrying that NATO is funding a project to quickly detect undersea-cable damage and reroute data to satellites. In a provocative commentary on why technology will define the future of geopolitics published in Foreign Affairs in 2023, Eric Schmidt, chair of the Special Competitive Studies Project and the former CEO and chair of Google, argues that “a country’s ability to project power in the international sphere—militarily, economically, and culturally—depends on its ability to innovate faster and better than its competitors.” In this issue, you’ll get an idea of how various nations are faring in this regard. In the coming year, you can look forward to our continuing analysis of how the new U.S. administration’s policies on basic research, climate change, regulation, and immigration impact global competition for the raw materials and human resources that stoke the engines of innovation.",

      "title": "As EV Sales Stall, Plug-In Hybrids Get a Reboot",
      "link": "https://spectrum.ieee.org/plug-in-hybrid",
      "contentSnippet": "Automakers got one thing right: Electrified cars are the future. What they got wrong was assuming that all of those vehicles would run on battery power alone, with gasoline-electric hybrid technology bound for the technological scrap heap.\n\n\t Now the automaking giants are scrambling to course correct. They’re delaying their EV plans, rejiggering factories, and acknowledging what some clear-eyed observers (including \n\tIEEE Spectrum) suspected all along: Not every car buyer is ready or able to ditch the internal-combustion engine entirely, stymied by high EV prices or unnerved by a patchy, often-unreliable charging infrastructure.\n\n\n\t\tThis article is part of our special report \n\t\tTop Tech 2025.\n\t\n\n\tConsumers are still looking for electrified rides, just not the ones that many industry pundits predicted. In \n\tChina, Europe, and the United States, buyers are converging on hybrids, whose sales growth is outpacing that of pure EVs. “It’s almost been a religion that it’s EVs or bust, so let’s not fool around with hybrids or hydrogen,” says Michael Dunne, CEO of Dunne Insights, a leading analyst of China’s auto industry. “But even in the world’s largest market, almost half of electrified vehicle sales are hybrids.”\n\n\t In China, which accounts for about two-thirds of global \n\telectrified sales, buyers are flocking to plug-in hybrids, or PHEVs, which combine a gas engine with a rechargeable battery pack. Together, hybrids and all-electric vehicles (a category that the Chinese government calls “new energy vehicles”) reached a milestone last July, outselling internal-combustion engine cars in that country for the first time. PHEV sales are up 85 percent year-over-year, dwarfing the 12-percent gain for pure EVs.\n\n\t The picture is different in the United States, where customers still favor conventional hybrids that combine a gas engine with a small battery—no plug involved, no driver action required. Through September 2024, this year’s conventional hybrid sales in the United States have soared past 1.1 million, accounting for 10.6 percent of the overall car market, versus an 8.9 percent share for pure EVs, according to \n\tWards Intelligence. Including PHEVs, that means a record 21 percent of the country’s new cars are now electrified.\n\n\tBut even as overall EV sales rise, plug-in hybrid sales have stalled at a mere 2 percent of the U.S. market. A J.D. Power \n\tsurvey also showed low levels of satisfaction among PHEV owners.\n\n\t Those numbers are a disappointment to automakers and regulators, who have looked to PHEVs as a bridge technology between gasoline vehicles and pure EVs. But what if the problem isn’t plug-in tech per se but the type of PHEVs being offered? Could another market pivot be just around the corner?\nPlug-in Hybrids: The Next Generation\n\tThe Ram brand, a part of \n\tStellantis, is betting on new plug-in technology with its Ram 1500 Ramcharger, a brash full-size pickup scheduled to go on sale later this year.\n\n\tThe Ramcharger is what’s known as an extended-range electric vehicle, or EREV. An EREV resembles a PHEV, pairing gas and electric powertrains, but with two key differences: An EREV integrates much larger batteries, enough to rack up significant all-electric miles before the internal-combustion engine kicks in; and the gas engine in an EREV is used entirely to generate electricity, not to propel the car directly.\n\nBMW demonstrated EREV tech beginning in 2013 with its pint-size i3 REx, which used a tiny motorcycle engine to generate electricity. The Chevrolet Volt, produced from 2010 to 2019, also used its gasoline engine largely as a generator, although it could partially propel the car in certain conditions. The short-lived 2012 Fisker Karma took a similar approach. None of these vehicles made much impact on the market. As a large pickup with conventional styling, the Ramcharger appears to be a more mainstream proposition.\n\n\nThe platform for the 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger includes a V6 engine, a 92-kilowatt-hour battery pack, and a 130-kilowatt generator. Stellantis\n\n\tThe Ramcharger shares its STLA Frame platform and electrical architecture with the upcoming pure-battery \n\tRam 1500 REV, but it’s designed to provide more driving range, along with the option of gasoline fill-ups when there are no EV chargers around. Although the Ramcharger’s 92-kilowatt-hour battery has less than half the capacity of the Ram REV’s humongous upgraded 229-kWh battery (the largest ever in a passenger EV), it’s hardly small. The Ramcharger still packs more battery power than many all-electric vehicles, such as the Ford Mustang Mach-E and the Tesla Model 3.\n\n\tOriginally, Ram planned to launch its EV pickup first. But based on consumer response, the brand decided to prioritize the Ramcharger; the Ram 1500 REV will now follow in 2026.\n\n\t Ram estimates that its pickup will travel about 233 kilometers (145 miles) on a fully charged battery, more than three times the stated 71-km electric range of a compact \n\tToyota Prius Prime, among the U.S. market’s longest-range PHEVs. For typical commuters and around-town drivers, “that’s enough range where you could really use this truck as an EV 95 percent of the time,” says Ed Kim, chief analyst of AutoPacific.\n\n\tWhen the battery runs down below a preset level, the gasoline engine kicks in and generates 130 kilowatts of electricity to the battery, which continues to feed the permanent-magnet motors that propel the car. Since the motors do all the work, an EREV mimics an EV, needing no conventional transmission or driveshaft. But the onboard generator enables the Ramcharger to drive much farther than any conventional EV can.\nExtended-Range EVs: The Long Haul\n\tWith batteries and gasoline working in tandem, the Ramcharger has an extended range of 1,110 km (690 miles), dwarfing the 824-km range of the \n\tLucid Air Grand Touring, the current EV long-distance champ. And unlike many PHEVs, whose performance suffers when they rely on battery juice alone, the Ramcharger doesn’t skimp on power. The system churns up a mighty 494 kW (663 horsepower) and 834 newton-meters of torque. Ram estimates the Ramcharger will go from 0 to 60 miles per hour (0 to 97 kilometers per hour) in 4.4 seconds.\n\n\tUsing the engine solely as a generator also addresses a couple of key criticisms of PHEVs: skimpy all-electric range, especially if the owner rarely bothers to plug it in, and compromised efficiency when the car runs primarily on gasoline.\n\n\t “Today’s PHEVs can be extremely efficient or extremely inefficient, all depending on how a customer decides to use it,” Kim says. “If they never plug in, it ends up being a hybrid that’s heavier than it needs to be, hauling around a battery it doesn’t really use.”\n\n\tIn an EREV, by contrast, the engine can operate constantly in its most frugal operating range, which maximizes its thermal efficiency, rather than constantly revving from idle to high speeds and wasting fuel.\n\n\t The Ramcharger should also excel at actual hauling. Some truck loyalists have soured on all-electric pickups like the \n\tFord F-150 Lightning, whose maximum 515-km range can drop by 50 percent or more when it’s towing or hauling heavy loads. The Ramcharger is rated to tow up to 14,000 pounds (6,350 kilograms) and to handle up to 2,625 pounds (1,190 kg) in its cargo bed. Company officials insist that its range won’t be unduly dinged by heavy lifting, although they haven’t yet revealed details.\nChina Embraces EREVs\n\tIf China is the bellwether for all things electric, the EREV could be the next big thing. EREVs now make up nearly a third of the nation’s plug-in-hybrid sales, according to \n\tBloomberg New Energy Finance. Beijing-based Li Auto, founded nine years ago by billionaire entrepreneur Xiang Li, makes EREVs exclusively; its sales jumped nearly 50 percent in 2024. Big players, including Geely Auto and SAIC Motor Corp., are also getting into the game.\n\n\nLi Auto’s Li L9, shown here at a 2024 auto show in Tianjin, China, is an extended-range hybrid SUV designed for China’s wide-open spaces.NurPhoto/Getty Images\n\n\tThe \n\tLi L9 is a formidable example of China’s EREV tech. The crossover SUV pairs a 44.5-kWh nickel cobalt manganese battery with a 1.5-liter turbo engine, for a muscular 330 kW (443 horsepower). Despite having a much smaller battery than the Ramcharger, the all-wheel-drive L9 can cover 180 km on a single charge. Then its four-cylinder engine, operating at a claimed 40.5 percent thermal efficiency, extends the total range to 1,100 km, perfect for China’s wide-open spaces.\n\n\t Dunne notes that in terms of geography and market preferences, China is more similar to the United States than it is to Europe. All-electric EVs predominate in China’s wealthier cities and coastal areas, but in outlying regions—characterized by long-distance drives and scarce public charging—many Chinese buyers are spurning EVs in favor of hybrids, much like their U.S. counterparts.\n\n\t Those parallels may bode well for EREV tech in the United States and elsewhere. When the Ramcharger was first announced in November 2023, it looked like an outlier. Since then, Nissan, Hyundai, Mazda, and General Motors’ Buick brand have all announced EREV plans of their own.\n\n\nVolkswagen’s Scout Traveler SUV, due out in 2027, is another entry in the extended-range electric vehicle (EREV) category.Scout Motors\n\n\tIn October, Volkswagen unveiled a revival of the Scout, the charming off-roaders built by International Harvester between 1960 and 1980. The announcement came with a surprise twist: Both the Scout Traveler SUV and Scout Terra pickup will offer EREV models. (In a nod to the brand’s history, Scout’s EREV system is called “Harvester.”) The hybrid versions will have an estimated 500-mile (800-km) range, easily beating the 350-mile (560-km) range of their all-electric siblings. According to a crowdsourced tracker, about \n\tfour-fifths of people reserving a Scout are opting for an EREV model.\nToyota Gets the Last Laugh\n\tFor \n\tToyota, the market swing toward hybrid vehicles comes as a major vindication. The world’s largest automaker had faced withering attacks for being slow to add all-electric vehicles to its lineup, focusing more on hybrids as a transitional technology. In 2021, Toyota’s decision to redesign its Sienna minivan exclusively as a hybrid seemed risky. Its decision to do the same with the 2025 Camry, America’s best-selling sedan, seemed riskier still. Now Toyota and its luxury brand, Lexus, control nearly 60 percent of the hybrid market in North America.\n\n\nToyota was criticized for sticking with hybrid cars like the Prius, but it now controls nearly 60 percent of the North American hybrid market. Toyota\n\n\tAlthough Toyota hasn’t yet announced any plans for an EREV, the latest Toyota Prius shows the fruits of five generations and nearly 30 years of hybrid R&D. A 2024 Prius starts at around $29,000, with up to 196 horsepower (146 kW) from its 2.0-liter Atkinson-cycle engine and tiny lithium-ion battery—enough to go 0-97 km/h in a little over 7 seconds. The larger 2025 Camry hybrid is rated at up to 48 miles per gallon (20 kilometers per liter).\n\n\t Market analysts expect the \n\tToyota RAV4, the most-popular SUV in the United States, to go hybrid-only around 2026. David Christ, Toyota’s North American general manager, indicated that “the company is not opposed” to eventually converting all of its internal-combustion models to hybrids.\n\n\tMeanwhile, GM, Ford, Honda, and other brands are rapidly introducing \n\tmore hybrids as well. Stellantis is offering plug-in models from Jeep, Chrysler, and Dodge in addition to the EREV Ramcharger. Even the world’s most rarefied sports-car brands are adopting hybrid technology because of its potential to improve performance significantly—and to do so without reducing fuel economy. [For more on high-performance hybrids, see \"A Hybrid Car That's Also a Supercar\".]\n\nThe electricity-or-nothing crowd may regard hybrids as a compromise technology that continues to prop up demand for fossil fuels. But by meeting EV-skeptical customers halfway, models that run on both batteries and gasoline could ultimately convert more people to electrification, hasten the extinction of internal-combustion dinosaurs, and make a meaningful dent in \n\tcarbon emissions.",

      "contentSnippet": "Aside from having four wheels, it’s hard to see what a US $30,000 Toyota Camry has in common with a $3 million Ferrari F80. But these market bookends are examples of an under-the-radar tech revolution. From budget transportation to hypercars, every category of internal-combustion car is now harnessing hybrid tech. In “As EV Sales Stall, Plug-In Hybrids Get a Reboot,” I describe the vanguard of this new hybrid boom: extended-range EVs like the 2025 Ram 1500 Ramcharger, which boasts a range of more than 1,000 kilometers. The world’s leading performance brands are also embracing hybrid EV tech—not merely to cut emissions or boost efficiency but because of the instant-on, highly controllable torque produced by electric motors. Hybridized models from BMW, Corvette, Ferrari, and Porsche are aimed at driving enthusiasts who have been notoriously resistant to electric cars. Sam Fiorani, vice-president of global vehicle forecasting for AutoForecast Solutions, predicts that “nearly all light-duty internal-combustion engines are likely to be hybridized in one form or another over the next decade.” Even mainstream electrified models, Fiorani notes, routinely generate acceleration times that were once limited to exotic machines. “The performance offered by electric motors cannot be accomplished by gas-powered engines alone without impacting emissions,” Fiorani says. “The high-end brands will need to make the leap that only an electric powertrain can practically provide.” That leap is well underway, as I experienced firsthand during test drives of the BMW M5, Corvette E-Ray, and Ferrari 296 GTB. These performance hybrids outperform their internal-combustion-only equivalents in almost every way. Most incorporate all-wheel-drive, along with torque vectoring, energy harvesting, and other engineering tricks that are possible with the inclusion of electric motors.2025 BMW M5: The Heavyweight Hybrid\n\nThe BMW M5 sedan is a literal heavyweight, tipping the scales at 2,435 kilograms.BMW The 2025 BMW M5 sedan adds plug-in hybrid power to one of the company’s iconic models. A twin-turbo, 4.4-liter V-8 engine pairs with a fifth-generation BMW eMotor and a 14.8-kilowatt-hour battery. The M5 can cruise silently on battery power for 69 km (43 miles). The biggest downside is the car’s crushing curb weight—up to 2,500 kilograms (5,500 pounds)—and poor fuel economy once its electric range is spent. The upside is 527 kilowatts (717 horsepower) of Teutonic aggression, which I experienced from Munich to the Black Forest, making Autobahn sprints at up to 280 kph (174 mph). Ferrari 296 GTB and F80: Top of the Hybrid Food Chain\n\nAlthough the Ferrari 296 GTB is a plug-in hybrid, its goal is high performance, not high gas mileage.Ferrari Ferrari’s swoopy 296 GTB is a plug-in hybrid with a 122-kW electric motor sandwiched between a 3.0-liter V-6 and an F1 automated gearbox, producing a total of 602 kilowatts (819 horsepower). The 296 GTB can cover just 25 km on electricity alone, but that could be enough to pass through European low-emission zones, where internal-combustion cars may eventually be banned. Of course, the 296 GTB’s main goal is high performance, not high gas mileage. A digital brake-by-wire system makes it Ferrari’s shortest-stopping production car, and the brakes regenerate enough energy that I was able to recharge the 7.5-kWh battery on-the-fly in roughly 10 minutes of driving. Despite its modest V-6 engine, the 296 GTB turns faster laps around Ferrari’s Fiorano test circuit than any V-8 model in company history. The Ferrari weighs in at 1,467 kilograms (3,234 pounds), unusually svelte for a hybrid, which aids its sharp handling. At the top of the hybrid food chain is Ferrari’s F80, a hypercar inspired by Formula 1 racers. It pairs a V-6 with five electric motors—two in turbochargers, three for propulsion—for a total of 882 kW (1,200 horsepower). The two electric motors driving the front wheels allow for independent torque vectoring. Only 799 of the F80s will be built, but those numbers do not capture the cultural impact of harnessing hybrid tech in one of the world’s most exclusive sports cars. Porsche 911 GTS T-Hybrid: A First for Porsche The Porsche 911 now has its first electrified design. The new Porsche 911 GTS T-Hybrid keeps the model’s classic flat-six, rear-engine layout but adds a 40-kW electric motor, for a combined 391 kW (532 horsepower). Another 20-kW motor drives a single electric turbocharger, which has much less lag and wasted heat than mechanical turbochargers do. \n\nPorsche’s 911 GTS T-Hybrid is the carmaker’s first electric car offering.PorscheThe 911 GTS T-Hybrid’s 400-volt system quickly spools that turbo up to 120,000 rpm; peak turbo boost arrives in less than one second, versus more than three seconds before [[",

      "contentSnippet": "Earlier this year, we reviewed the SwitchBot S10, a vacuuming and wet mopping robot that uses a water-integrated docking system to autonomously manage both clean and dirty water for you. It’s a pretty clever solution, and we appreciated that SwitchBot was willing to try something a little different. At CES this week, SwitchBot introduced the K20+ Pro, a little autonomous vacuum that can integrate with a bunch of different accessories by pulling them around on a backpack cart of sorts. The K20+ Pro is SwitchBot’s latest effort to explore what’s possible with mobile home robots.\n\nSwitchBot’s small vacuum can transport different payloads on top.SwitchBotWhat we’re looking at here is a “mini” robotic vacuum (it’s about 25 centimeters in diameter) that does everything a robotic vacuum does nowadays: It uses lidar to make a map of your house so that you can direct it where to go, it’s got a dock to empty itself and recharge, and so on. The mini robotic vacuum is attached to a wheeled platform that SwitchBot is calling a “FusionPlatform” that sits on top of the robot like a hat. The vacuum docks to this platform, and then the platform will go wherever the robot goes. This entire system (robot, dock, and platform) is the “K20+ Pro multitasking household robot.”SwitchBot refers to the K20+ Pro as a “smart delivery assistant,” because you can put stuff on the FusionPlatform and the K20+ Pro will move that stuff around your house for you. This really doesn’t do it justice, though, because the platform is much more than just a passive mobile cart. It also can provide power to a bunch of different accessories, all of which benefit from autonomous mobility:\n\nThe SwitchBot can carry a variety of payloads, including custom payloads.SwitchBotFrom left to right, you’re looking at an air circulation fan, a tablet stand, a vacuum and charging dock and an air purifier and security camera (and a stick vacuum for some reason), and lastly just the air purifier and security setup. You can also add and remove different bits, like if you want the fan along with the security camera, just plop the security camera down on the platform base in front of the fan and you’re good to go.This basic concept is somewhat similar to Amazon’s Proteus robot, in the sense that you can have one smart powered base that moves around a bunch of less smart and unpowered payloads by driving underneath them and then carrying them around. But SwitchBot’s payloads aren’t just passive cargo, and the base can provide them with a useful amount of power.\n\nA power port allows you to develop your own payloads for the robot.SwitchBotSwitchBot is actively encouraging users to “to create, adapt, and personalize the robot for a wide variety of innovative applications,” which may include “3D-printed components [or] third-party devices with multiple power ports for speakers, car fridges, or even UV sterilization lamps,” according to the press release. The maximum payload is only 8 kilograms, though, so don’t get too crazy.\n\nSeveral SwitchBots can make bath time much more enjoyable.SwitchBotWhat we all want to know is when someone will put an arm on this thing, and SwitchBot is of course already working on this:\n\nSwitchBot’s mobile manipulator is still in the lab stage.SwitchBotThe arm is still “in the lab stage,” SwichBot says, which I’m guessing means that the hardware is functional but that getting it to reliably do useful stuff with the arm is still a work in progress. But that’s okay—getting an arm to reliably do useful stuff is a work in progress for all of robotics, pretty much. And if SwitchBot can manage to produce an affordable mobile manipulation platform for consumers that even sort of works, that’ll be very impressive.",

But how do you make sure you don't drop those aspirations by February? Alex has some tips and tricks to get you focused for the year ahead - and ensure your dreams become reality. \n\nTips &amp; Tricks to Help You on Your 2025 Journey: \n\nBuild a system versus just setting goals. This will help you achieve your goals by creating a more sustainable system that fits with your lifestyle. For example, if you want to improve your coding skills, make a habit to set aside some time each day to work on it. Keep your habits low impact and realistic. As a plus, this will save you a LOT of stress.\nProcrastination is your biggest pitfall. We all fall into this trap but try your best to avoid it. Use lists, timeblocking, and have alternate projects you can lean on when you need to deviate from your scheduled tasks. You can also hit up the two-minute trick: If something just takes you only a few minutes to do, then do it. \nStart early! There is no better time than the present to start something new. If you don't feel up to something, tomorrow will likely be no different for you. Therefore, avoid putting things off as much as you can. \nSkip one day, but never more than that. Give yourself some grace, and if you need to let a day slide, that's okay. However, if you find yourself adding another day to your grace period, it's probable that you will only continue to add more days. This trick will help you save yourself from the &quot;habit graveyard&quot; (as Alex puts it).\n\nWhat tricks help you stay on track with your goals? Other members of the TCMS community would love to see what works for you! We will be sharing more goalsetting resources and career maps, so keep following us for some support on your 2025 journey! \n\n#goalsetting #goalsettingjourney #cybersecurity #goalsetting2025 #professionaldevelopment \n\n📱Social Media📱\n___________________________________________\nX: https://x.com/TCMSecurity\nTwitch: https://www.twitch.tv/thecybermentor\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/tcmsecurity/\nLinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/tcm-security-inc/\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@tcmsecurity\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/tcm\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/tcmsecure\n\n💸Donate💸\n___________________________________________\nLike the channel?

      "contentSnippet": "Just as the right conference room technology can support effective meetings, the wrong tools can hinder collaboration — and many conference rooms were equipped prior to the massive shift to hybrid work that started in 2020. While most healthcare roles are currently in-person only, support staff such as IT and even executive leadership may require hybrid collaboration. And on the clinical side, care teams often need to collaborate with offsite specialists, virtual nurses or care team members at different locations.\nHere are four practical tips to boost the effectiveness of group meetings in…",

      "link": "https://www.reversinglabs.com/blog/the-secs-8-k-cybersecurity-incident-disclosures-for-2024-timeline",
      "contentSnippet": "It’s been more than a year since the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new rules to enhance the annual reporting of cybersecurity measures practiced by SEC registrants. These requirements are in addition to those about the timely disclosure of material cybersecurity incidents that these companies experience. This tougher stance from the SEC has prompted executives and boards of directors to look at cybersecurity, not as an afterthought, but as a business-critical priority. The SEC’s new rules also hold these leaders and their companies legally accountable should they not follow the agency's cybersecurity rules — putting chief information security officers in the hot seat. In the first year of the program, more than 20 cybersecurity incidents were disclosed to the commission via corporations' filings of Form 8-K. Listed below in chronological order are those 22 filings, including details such as the filing date, the target of the incident, and the impact that the incident had on the business.While the SEC’s cybersecurity-incident disclosure rules are generally positive for the betterment of cybersecurity, readers who follow the links for each filing will see that the vast majority of these disclosures don’t yield much information beyond what we describe below. Details missing from the forms include the type of attack, the identity of the attack’s perpetrators, and how the perpetrators were able to breach the company’s systems in the first place. This is because the SEC’s rules for Form 8-K only ask registrants to disclose “The material aspects of the nature, scope, and timing of the incident; and the material impact or reasonably likely material impact on the registrant, including on the registrant’s financial condition and results of operations.” The commission also clearly stated in its announcement of the new rules last year that it doesn’t require registrants “to disclose specific or technical information about its planned response to the incident or its cybersecurity systems, related networks and devices, or potential system vulnerabilities in such detail that would impede its response or remediation of the incident.”What this means is that these 8-K disclosure rules do not provide the attack transparency that the cybersecurity community could use to bolster critical systems against similar incidents, bestowing instead only higher-level benefits to key market players, who will become more aware of registrants’ cybersecurity practices, and to registrants, who hopefully will take their cybersecurity efforts more seriously. Of course, some of the 8-K filings concern attacks previously reported in the media, and so we know something about the type of attack in those cases. Here are some of the trends that can be gleaned from that information.",

      "contentSnippet": "Rhode Island Governor Dan McKee has confirmed that cybercriminals are attempting to leak stolen data after gaining unauthorized access to the state's central platform for operating numerous health and human services divisions, including social benefits. \nWHY IT MATTERS\nMcKee’s office said Monday that, according to its consultant Deloitte, the hackers who broke into the IT system for the state's health and benefits programs earlier this month have released a set of files on the dark web, WPRI reported.\n\"Today the cyber criminals did in fact publish at least some of the Rhode Island Bridge's information and data files onto the dark web,\" McKee said during a press conference.\nIn a previous update on its website, the state said that Deloitte confirmed \"a high probability that a cybercriminal has obtained files with personally identifiable information.\"\nThe consultant is working with the state to generate the list of impacted individuals. \n\"Once we have that information, we will send letters to those individuals with instructions on how to access free credit monitoring,\" the alert said.\nHealthSource RI, the state’s marketplace for affordable health coverage, is part of the Ocean State's Department of Administration RIBridges system and is temporarily unavailable due to the cyberattack announced on December 13. \nAccording to the state website, the system that Deloitte manages is the main operations system for the state's management, including legal services, accounts and control, management and budget, purchasing, auditing, human resources, certain personnel services, capital asset management and maintenance, IT, energy resources and many internal services.\nThe state took the system offline after Deloitte discovered the network intrusion. \nRIBridges also manages the state's Medicaid, SNAP and other social programs, many of which have switched to manual processes. \nDue to the outage, HealthSource RI has extended open enrollment from Tuesday's deadline until February 28 via call center. Patients with plans that would not automatically renew for 2025 will now be extended until the system is restored and they can select new plans, according to the website alert.\nGovernment officials said they have identified about 650,000 people whose personal information – including Social Security and bank account numbers – was stolen from the system.\nDatabreaches.net reported Monday that it had made contact with Brain Cipher, and the ransomware group confirmed that they were responsible for the RIBridges attack and inspected the archive file with personal information provided by the threat actors. \nReaching the threat actors’ dark web leak site is challenging, however, according to the story. \nBrain Cipher told the publication that they have been under a denial of service attack to try and stop them from leaking the data. \nTHE LARGER TREND\nState records systems that hold protected health information are targeted in cyberattacks and criminals have been known to publish protected data.\nIn July, RansomHub began leaking Florida Department of Health employee records, prescription data, screening information, Social Security numbers and more on a Tor-based leak site. The group claimed to have stolen 100 gigabytes of data from the Sunshine State's public health network.\nHealthcare cybersecurity challenges outpace every other sector, according to an analysis of 2023 cyberattacks by SecurityScorecard, a supply chain cybersecurity firm. \nThe sector also leads in third-party data breaches, which snare providers, health plans, healthcare organizations and public health networks. Two years ago, a ransomware attack on a federal vendor, Healthcare Management Solutions, had the potential to impact up to 254,000 Medicare beneficiaries.\nWhile the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services said that the vendor acted in \"violation of its obligations,\" the federal agency is also under investigation by the U.S. Health and Human Services Office of Civil Rights for a cyber breach that ultimately affected 3,112,815 individuals, reported in September.\nThe recent CMS data breach was one in a string related to a vulnerability in the file transfer tool MOVEit.\nON THE RECORD\n\"Our top priority is exactly what we talked about – informing people, getting the information out, having people protect their identity and also get those benefits out,\" McKee said in response to a question about the state's continued relationship with Deloitte at Monday's televised press conference. \"The issues that have to do with IT, we will take those issues one day at a time.\"\nAndrea Fox is senior editor of Healthcare IT News.\nEmail: afox@himss.org\nHealthcare IT News is a HIMSS Media publication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Enterprise Taxonomy: Health Information ExchangeCybersecurity and PrivacySecurityData and Information",

      "contentSnippet": "Ransomware attacks are having a severe impact on U.S. healthcare organizations, with an alarming escalation in incidents and their consequences, according to a Comparitech report.\nThe study found that since 2018, 654 ransomware attacks have targeted healthcare providers, with 2023 standing out as a record-breaking year, logging 143 incidents.\nThese attacks compromised over 88.7 million patient records during this period, with more than 26.2 million breached in 2023 alone.\nEach day of downtime due to ransomware costs healthcare organizations an average of $1.9 million, culminating in an estimated $21.9 billion in downtime losses over six years.\nOn average, medical organizations experienced 17 days of downtime per incident, with the highest disruptions reported in 2022, averaging 27 days.\nRebecca Moody, head of data research at Comparitech, noted the evolving nature of ransomware threats in healthcare.\n\"One of the most significant changes in ransomware attacks has been the increased focus on stealing large amounts of data,\" she said. \"If we look at the top 10 ransomware data breaches since 2018, seven of them occurred in 2023 and 2024.\"\nShe explained healthcare organizations are particularly vulnerable to ransomware attacks due to their reliance on operational continuity and sensitive patient data.\n\"Healthcare organizations can ill-afford downtime,\" Moody said. \"Losing access to systems can cause widespread chaos, delayed healthcare, and even errors in medication dispensing.\"\nShe said hackers often leverage this urgency, employing double-extortion tactics by encrypting systems while exfiltrating data to increase the pressure for ransom payments.\nMoody stressed that preparation is key to minimizing the impact of ransomware attacks.\n\"The key is being prepared for the worst-case scenario,\" she said. \"Having an incident response team, a communication plan, and clear instructions for managing threats and recovering data can help healthcare companies recover quickly.\"\nFrequent data backups are also essential to recovery efforts, but many organizations face challenges in implementing them due to budget constraints and gaps in employee training.\nAs ransomware tactics continue to evolve, Moody emphasized the importance of robust cybersecurity measures to protect sensitive patient data and maintain operational integrity. \n\"Having a plan in place can help hospitals and clinics maintain continuity of care, even during prolonged system outages,\" she said.\nThe report comes as Nebraska's Attorney General filed a lawsuit against UnitedHealth Group and its subsidiaries Change Healthcare and Optum following a ransomware attack that disrupted critical healthcare services across the state.\nHealthcare organizations are still struggling to get a handle on cybersecurity as threats explode and complexity of defense increases, with the rise of AI also causing concern.\n\n\n\n\nNathan Eddy is a healthcare and technology freelancer based in Berlin.\nEmail the writer: nathaneddy@gmail.com\nTwitter: @dropdeaded209\n\n\n Enterprise Taxonomy: ",

This classic, yet often overlooked technique can allow attackers to remove cookies from a target user and replace them with their own—leading to serious security risks like account takeovers. When combined with vulnerabilities like session fixation, the impact can be devastating.\n\n🔍 In this video, we’ll cover:\n\n- The theory behind cookie jar behavior and browser quirks.\n- How attackers manipulate session cookies using this technique.\n- A live demo of Cookie Jar Overflow in action, set up in a controlled lab environment.\n\nKey Concepts Explained:\nBrowsers have cookie limits (e.g., ~160-165 cookies in Chrome/Firefox). By flooding the cookie jar, attackers can push out important cookies (like session cookies) and inject their own. If the web app doesn't validate cookies properly, the attacker gains control. This attack is even more dangerous when paired with Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.\n\nOther Use Cases:\nCookie Jar Overflow isn’t just about session fixation. It can also be used for:\n- Cache poisoning with malicious cache keys.\n- Manipulating application state via cookie-stored flags.\n\nDon't miss out on this critical insight into a technique that could bypass traditional security defenses!

      "link": "https://www.businesstechworld.com/2024/12/mysk2-dyndns-org-explained-guide.html",
      "contentSnippet": " The world of Dynamic Domain Name System (DynDNS) services is vast, and various providers offer unique features to cater to the specific needs of users. One such provider is \"Mysk2 DynDNS Org,\" a name that has started to gain traction for offering flexible and robust services in the realm of dynamic DNS. This article will delve into the specifics of Mysk2 DynDNS Org, explaining what it is, how it works, its features, and its importance in modern networking. Additionally, we will answer some frequently asked questions (FAQs) to provide further clarity on this service.What is Mysk2 DynDNS Org?Mysk2 DynDNS Org is a Dynamic DNS (DDNS) service provider that allows users to assign domain names to dynamic IP addresses. This service is particularly beneficial for individuals or businesses that have internet connections with dynamic IPs but still want to access their devices or services remotely through a stable domain name.Typically, an internet connection uses a dynamic IP address, meaning it changes periodically. This can create challenges for users who need to access their home or office network remotely, as the IP address is not constant. Mysk2 DynDNS Org solves this issue by providing users with a static domain name that automatically updates when the dynamic IP changes.Key Features of Mysk2 DynDNS Org1. Automatic IP UpdatesThe primary benefit of using Mysk2 DynDNS Org is the automatic update of IP addresses. When your IP address changes, Mysk2 DynDNS Org will automatically detect the change and update your domain name accordingly. This ensures you can access your devices without manually tracking or updating IP addresses.2. Custom Domain SupportMysk2 DynDNS Org allows users to set up custom domain names, making it easier for people to remember and access their services. Whether it’s for a personal website, server, or home surveillance system, you can create a subdomain (e.g., myserver.mysk2.dyndns.org) or even point a custom domain to your dynamic IP.3. Easy ConfigurationSetting up Mysk2 DynDNS Org is straightforward. Users only need to create an account, configure the router or the device to update the IP, and then link the domain to their IP address. There are many tutorials and guides available to help users with the setup process.4. Security FeaturesSecurity is a critical concern when dealing with remote access. Mysk2 DynDNS Org integrates security protocols to ensure the integrity of your data. It supports encrypted connections and provides options for securing access to your network.5. Device CompatibilityMysk2 DynDNS Org supports a wide range of devices, including routers, IP cameras, and home servers. It integrates seamlessly with many third-party applications, providing maximum flexibility for users with diverse needs.6. Low LatencyMysk2 DynDNS Org offers low-latency connections for faster and more reliable access to your network. This is especially useful for applications such as remote desktop access, IP surveillance, and online gaming.7. Multiple SubdomainsFor users with multiple devices or services that require dynamic DNS, Mysk2 DynDNS Org allows the creation of multiple subdomains under a single account. This is useful for people who want to access various services through different domain names but manage them all from one central dashboard.8. Free and Paid PlansMysk2 DynDNS Org offers both free and premium subscription options. While the free version provides basic functionality, paid plans unlock additional features such as more subdomains, custom domains, and enhanced support.How Does Mysk2 DynDNS Org Work?Dynamic DNS works by associating a domain name with a dynamic IP address. This association is maintained by periodically updating the DNS records as the IP address changes. In the case of Mysk2 DynDNS Org, the following steps illustrate how the system works:1. Dynamic IP AddressWhen you sign up for an internet connection, you are typically assigned a dynamic IP address by your Internet Service Provider (ISP). This IP address is not fixed and can change at any time, depending on your ISP's policy.2. Creating an Account on Mysk2 DynDNS OrgTo get started, you need to sign up for an account on Mysk2 DynDNS Org. Once registered, you will be able to create a unique subdomain (e.g., mydevice.mysk2.dyndns.org).3. Router or Device ConfigurationOnce your account is set up, you need to configure your router or device to automatically update the dynamic DNS service with the current IP address. Many modern routers have built-in support for DDNS services like Mysk2 DynDNS Org. For those that do not, software solutions or scripts can be used to handle the task.4. IP Address DetectionMysk2 DynDNS Org uses special software or router integration to monitor your IP address. When the IP address changes (usually due to a router reset, a lease expiry, or other factors), the service automatically detects the change and updates the DNS records to reflect the new address.5. Accessing Your NetworkWith the DNS records updated, you can now use your custom domain name to access your network services remotely. For example, if you set up a server at home, you can access it by typing \"mydevice.mysk2.dyndns.org\" into a web browser or remote access software, without needing to know your dynamic IP address.6. MaintenanceMysk2 DynDNS Org also offers periodic maintenance to ensure that the DNS records remain up-to-date. This service reduces the need for manual intervention, keeping things running smoothly even as your IP address changes.Why is Mysk2 DynDNS Org Important?1. Remote Access to DevicesOne of the primary reasons for using Mysk2 DynDNS Org is to enable remote access to devices. Whether it’s accessing your home computer, media server, or surveillance camera system, Mysk2 ensures you can always reach your devices using a fixed domain name, even though your IP address is constantly changing.2. Home ServersFor individuals running home servers for gaming, file sharing, or even hosting a website, Mysk2 DynDNS Org is essential. By using this service, users can keep their server accessible through a consistent domain name.3. Cost-Effective SolutionFor small businesses or individuals who need a static IP address for their services but cannot afford the cost of a static IP from their ISP, Mysk2 DynDNS Org offers a low-cost solution. The free tier provides basic functionality, while the paid versions are still significantly cheaper than purchasing a dedicated static IP.4. Support for IoT DevicesWith the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, Mysk2 DynDNS Org plays a key role in allowing users to remotely access and control these devices. Whether it’s a smart home system or a security camera, Mysk2 helps provide access even when the underlying IP address changes.5.

Posted by James Forshaw, Google Project ZeroThis is a short blog post about some recent improvements I've been making to the OleView.NET tool which has been released as part of version 1.16. The tool is designed to discover the attack surface of Windows COM and find security vulnerabilities such as privilege escalation and remote code execution. The updates were recently presented at the Microsoft Bluehat conference in Redmond under the name \"DCOM Research for Everyone!\". This blog expands on the topics discussed to give a bit more background and detail that couldn't be fit within the 45-minute timeslot. This post assumes a knowledge of COM as I'm only going to describe a limited number of terms.Using the OleView.NET Tooling\n Before we start the discussion it's important to understand how you can get hold of the OleView.NET tool and some basic usage. The simplest way to get the tooling is to install it from the PowerShell gallery with the Install-Module OleViewDotNet command. This installs both the PowerShell module and the GUI. \n \n Next you need to parse the COM registration artifacts into an internal database. You can do this by running the Get-ComDatabase command. Once it's finished you're ready to go. You will notice that it can take a long time to complete, so it'd be annoying to have to do this every time you want to start researching. For that reason you can use the command Set-ComDatabase -Default to write out the database to a default storage location. Now the next time you start PowerShell you can just run an inspection command, such as Get-ComClass and the default database will be automatically loaded. \n \n This default database is also shared with the GUI, which you can start by running the Show-ComDatabase command. For general research I find the GUI to be easier to use and you can click around and look at the COM registration information. For analysis, the ability to script through PowerShell is more important.Researching COM Services\n Performing security research in COM usually involves the following steps::Enumerate potential COM classes of interest. These might be classes which are accessible outside of a sandbox, running at high privilege or designed to be remotely exposed.Validate whether the COM classes are truly accessible from the attack position. COM has various security controls which determine what users can launch, activate and access an object. Understanding these security controls allows the list of COM classes of interest to be limited to only those that are actually part of the attack surface.Enumerate exposed interfaces, determine what they do and call methods on them to test for security vulnerabilities.\n \n The last step is the focus of the updates to the tooling, making it easier to determine what an exposed interface does and call methods to test the behavior. The goal is to minimize the amount of reverse engineering needed (although generally some is still required) as well as avoid needing to write code outside of the tooling to interact with the COM service under test.\n \n To achieve this goal, OleView.NET will pull together any sources of interface information it has, then provide a mechanism to inspect and invoke methods on the interface through the UI or via PowerShell. The sources of information that it currently pulls together are:\n Known interfaces, either defined in the base .NET framework class libraries or inside OleView.NET.COM interface definitions present in the Global Assembly Cache.Registered type libraries.Windows Runtime interfaces.Extracted proxy class marshaling information.\n \n One useful benefit of gathering this information, is that the tool formats the interface as \"source code\" so you can manually inspect it.Formatting Interfaces Definitions\n The OleView.NET tool uses a database object to represent all the artifacts it has analyzed on your system. The latest released version defines some of these objects to be convertible to \"source code\". For example the following can be converted if the tool can determine some meta data that to represent the artifact:COM interfacesCOM proxiesCOM Windows Runtime classes.Type libraries, interfaces and classes.\n \n How you get to this conversion depends on whether you're using the PowerShell or the UI. The simplest approach is PowerShell, using the ConvertTo-ComSourceCode command. For example, the following will convert an interface object into source code:\n \n PS > Get-ComInterface -Name IMyInterface | ConvertTo-ComSourceCode -Parse\n \n Note that we also need to pass a -Parse option to the command. Some metadata such as type libraries and proxies can be expensive to parse so it won't do that automatically. However, once they're been parsed in the current session the metadata is cached for further use, so for example if you formatted a single interface in a type library, all other interfaces are now also parsed and can be formatted.\n \n The output of this command is the converted \"source code\" as text. The format depends on metadata source. For example the following is the output from a Windows Runtime type:\n \n [Guid(\"155eb23b-242a-45e0-a2e9-3171fc6a7fdd\")]\n interface IUserStatics\n {\n     /* Methods */\n     UserWatcher CreateWatcher();\n     IAsyncOperation FindAllAsync();\n     IAsyncOperation FindAllAsync(UserType type);\n     IAsyncOperation FindAllAsync(UserType type, \n                                        UserAuthenticationStatus status);\n     User GetFromId(string nonRoamableId);\n }\n \n As Windows Runtime types are defined using metadata similar to .NET then the output is a pseudo C# format. In contrast for type library or proxy it's look more like the following:\n \n [\n     odl,\n     uuid(00000512-0000-0010-8000-00AA006D2EA4),\n     dual,\n     oleautomation,\n     nonextensible\n ]\n interface _Collection : IDispatch {\n     [id(1), propget]\n     HRESULT Count([out, retval] int* c);\n     [id(0xFFFFFFFC), restricted]\n     HRESULT _NewEnum([out, retval] IUnknown** ppvObject);\n     [id(2)]\n     HRESULT Refresh();\n };\n \n This is in the Microsoft Interface Definition Language (MIDL) format, the type library version should be pretty accurate and could even be recompiled by the MIDL compiler. For proxies some of the information is lost and so the MIDL generated isn't completely accurate, but as we'll see later there's limited reasons to take the output and recompile. \n \n Another thing to note is that proxies lose name information when compiled from MIDL to their C marshaled representation. Therefore the tool just generates placeholder names, for example, method names are of the form \"ProcN\". If the proxy is for a type that has a known definition, such as from a Windows Runtime type or a type library then the tool will try and automatically apply the names. If not, you'll need to manually change them if you want them to be anything other than the default.\n \n You can change the names from PowerShell by modifying the proxy object directly. For example the \"IBitsTest1\" interface looks like the following before doing anything:\n \n [\n   object,\n   uuid(51A183DB-67E0-4472-8602-3DBC730B7EF5),\n ]\n interface IBitsTest1 : IUnknown {\n     HRESULT Proc3([out, string] wchar_t** p0);\n }\n \n You can modify \"Proc3\" with the following script:\n \n PS > $proxy = Get-ComProxy -Iid 51A183DB-67E0-4472-8602-3DBC730B7EF5\n PS > $proxy.Procedures[0].Name = \"GetBitsDllPath\"\n PS > $proxy.Procedures[0].Parameters[0].Name = \"DllPath\"\n \n Now the formatted output looks like the following:\n \n [\n   object,\n   uuid(51A183DB-67E0-4472-8602-3DBC730B7EF5),\n ]\n interface IBitsTest1 : IUnknown {\n     HRESULT GetBitsDllPath([out, string] wchar_t** DllPath);\n }\n \n This renaming will also be important when we come back to calling proxied methods. Obviously it'd be annoying to run this script every time, so you can cache the names using the following command:\n PS > Export-ComProxyName -Proxy $p -ToCache\n \n This will write out a file describing the names to a local cache file. When the proxy is loaded again in another session this cache file will be automatically applied. The Export-ComProxyName and corresponding Import-ComProxyName commands allow you to read and write XML or JSON files representing the proxy names which you can modify in a text editor if that's easier.\n \n One of the quickest wins is to enumerate the interfaces for a COM object, then pass the output of that through the ConvertTo-ComSource code command. For example:\n \n PS > $obj = New-ComObject -Clsid 4575438f-a6c8-4976-b0fe-2f26b80d959e\n PS > Get-ComInterface -Object $obj | ConvertTo-ComSourceCode -Parse\n \n This creates a new COM object based on its CLSID, enumerates the interfaces it supports and then passes them through the conversion process to get out a \"source code\" representation of the interfaces.\n \n To view the source code in the GUI you first need to open one of the database views from the Registry menu. In the resulting window, there will be a tree view of artifacts. You need to open the source code viewer window by right clicking the tree and selecting the Show Source Code option in the context menu. This will result in a view similar to the following:\n \n \n \n You can also automatically enable the source code view from the View→Registry View Options menu. In that menu you can also enable automatically parsing the interface information, which is off by default. \n \n You might notice in the screenshot that there's some text which is underlined. This indicates names which can be changed, and it is only used for proxies. You can right click the name and choose Edit Name from the context menu to bring up a text entry dialog. You can then change the name to suit. If you want to persist the names between sessions then set the Save Proxy Names on Exit option in the registry view options. Then when you exit any modified proxies will be written to the cache.\n \n If you want to edit a proxy from PowerShell in a similar GUI you can use following command:\n \n PS > Edit-ComSourceCode $proxy\n \n This will show a dialog similar to the following where you can do edits to the proxy name information:\n \n \n Genering Interfaces from a Proxy Definition\n \n Now on to the more important side of these updates, the ability to invoke methods on the interfaces exposed by an object you want to research. The tool has always given you some ability to invoke methods as long as the object has a .NET interface to call through reflection. This could either be through a known interface type, such as a built-in one or the Windows Runtime interfaces or by converting a type library into a .NET assembly on demand.\n \n What's new is the ability to generate an interface based on a proxy definition and then use that to invoke methods. Initially I tried to implement this by generating an .NET interface dynamically which would then use the existing .NET interop to call the proxy methods. This worked fine for simple proxies but quickly hit problems when doing anything more complex:Some types are hard to represent in easy to use .NET types, such as pointers to structures. This is \"handled\" in the type library converter by just exporting them as IntPtr parameters which means the caller has to manually marshal the data. Get this wrong and the tool crashes.Any structures need to be accurately laid out so the native marshaler can read and write to the correct field locations. Get this wrong and the tool crashes.Did I mention that if you get this wrong the tool crashes?\n \n Fortunately I already had a solution, my sandbox library already had the ability to dynamically generate a .NET class from parsed NDR data, in fact I was already using the library to parse the NDR data for proxies so I realized could I repurpose the existing client builder for COM proxy clients. I needed to do some simple refactoring of the code to make it build from a COM proxy instance rather than an RPC server, but I quickly had an RPC client. This RPC client doesn't directly interact with any native marshaling code, so it's unlikely to crash. Also any complex structures are built in a way which makes it easy to modify from .NET removing the problems around pointers. One issue with using the RPC client method is the same interface could be used for both in-process and out-of-process objects. Due to the way COM is designed a client usually doesn't need to care about where the object is, but in this case it must be accessible via a proxy. This isn't that big an issue, there's no security boundary between in-process COM objects and so being able to call methods on them isn't that interesting.\n \n The next problem was the RPC transport. COM calls have an additional input and output parameter, the ORPTHIS and ORPCTHAT structures, that need to be added to the call. These parameters could have been added to the RPC client, but it would seem best to make the clients agnostic of the transport. Instead as my RPC code has pluggable RPC transport I was able to reimplement a custom version over the top of the existing ALPC and TCP transports which added the additional parameters to any call. That wasn't the end of it though, ALPC needs an additional pair of parameters, LocalThis and LocalThat, which are potentially different depending on versions of Windows. Also you need to add support for additional services such as the OXID resolver and communication with the local DCOM activator. While I implemented all this it wasn't as reliable as I'd like, however it's still present in the source code if you want to play with it. \n \n As an aside, I should point out that Clement Rouault, one of the original researchers into ALPC RPC protocol of which parts of my own implementation is inspired, recently released a very similar project for their Python tooling which implements the ALPC DCOM protocol.\n \n I decided that I'd need a different approach, in the COM runtime the RPC channel used by a proxy instance is represented by the IRpcChannelBuffer interface. An object implementing this interface is connected to the proxy during initialization, it is then used to send and receive NDR formatted data from the client to the server. The implementation handles all the idiosyncrasies such as the additional parameters, handling OXID resolving and reference counting. If we could get hold of a proxy object's instance of the IRpcChannelBuffer object, we could use that instead of implementing our own protocol, the challenge was how to get it.\n \n After a bit of research I found that we can use the documented NdrProxyInitialize function to get hold of the interface from its MIDL_STUB_MESSAGE structure by passing in the interface pointer to a proxy. While it wouldn't be as flexible as a fully custom implementation this gave me an easy way to handle the transport without worrying about platform or protocol differences. It could also work from an existing COM object, just query the appropriate interface, extract the buffer and make calls to the remote server.\n \n Of course nothing is that simple, I discovered that while the IRpcChannelBuffer object is a COM object it has a broken implementation of IMarshal. As .NET's COM interop tries to query for IMarshal when generating a Runtime Callable Wrapper, it will immediately crash the process. I had to manually dispatch the calls to the method through native delegates, but at least it works. \n Calling Interface Methods\n Okay, so how do you use the tool to call arbitrary methods? For the GUI it works like it always has, when you create an instance of a COM object, usually by right clicking an entry in a view and selecting Create Instance you'll get a new object information window similar to the following:\n \n \n \n At the bottom of the window is a list of supported interfaces. In the right column is an indicator if there's a viewer for that interface. If it's set to Yes, then you can double click it to bring up an invocation window like the following:\n \n \n \n From this window you can double click a method to bring up a new dialog where you can specify the arguments and invoke the method as shown below.\n \n \n \n Once invoked it'll show the resulting output parameters and if the return value is an integer will assume it's a HRESULT error code. These windows are the same for \"reflected\" interfaces such as type libraries and Windows Runtime interfaces as well as proxy clients. The names of proxy methods won't be automatically updated if you change them when the interface window is open. You'll need to go back to the object information window and double click the interface again to get it to recreate the client.\n \n For PowerShell you can specify an Iid argument when using the New-ComObject command or use the Get-ComObjectInterface command to query an existing COM object for a new interface. The tooling will pick the best option for calling the interface from the options available to it, including generating the RPC client dynamically. \n \n PS > $obj = New-ComObject -Clsid 4991D34B-80A1-4291-83B6-3328366B9097\n PS > $test = Get-ComObjectInterface $o -Iid 51A183DB-67E0-4472-8602-3DBC730B7EF5\n PS > $test.GetBitsDllPath()\n \n DllPath                      retval\n -------                      ------\n c:windowssystem32qmgr.dll      0\n \n To make it easier to call interface methods from PowerShell the exposed methods on the object will be modified to wrap output parameters in a single return value. You can see this in the listing above, the DllPath parameter was originally an output only parameter. Rather than deal with  that in the script a return structure was automatically created containing the DllPath as well as the HRESULT return value. If the parameter is an input and output then the method signature accepts the input value and the return value contains the output value.\n \n If the definitions for your interface don't already exist you can import them into the tool to be used by the automatic interface selection. To do this you'll need to define the interfaces as .NET types and compile them into an assembly. Then in the GUI use the File→Import Interop Assembly menu option or for PowerShell use the Add-ComObjectInterface command. Both of these options allow you to specify the assembly will be automatically loaded the next time you start the tool. This will make a copy of the DLL to a central location so that it can be accessed even if you delete the library later.\n \n If all you have is an IDL file for a set of COM interfaces you can import them into the tool indirectly with help from the Windows SDK. First compile the IDL file using the MIDL compiler to generate a type library, then use the TLBIMP command to generate an Assembly file from the type library. Finally you can import it using the previous paragraph's methods.\n \n There's plenty to discover in OleView.NET which I've not covered here. I'd encourage you to play around, or check out the source code on github.",

      "contentSnippet": "TechHive opened for business in 2012 as a general consumer tech site. In 2017, we narrowed the focus to smart home and video streaming, responding to the hottest new developments in personal tech. It’s been a great run, but today we’re announcing that all new TechHive content will be published to sister site PCWorld on a just-launched TechHive section.\n\n\n\nWhy the change? First, we want TechHive content to reach as many people as possible, and PCWorld simply has a much larger audience of tech enthusiasts, DIYers, and early adopters. PCWorld launched as a computer magazine in 1983 and became a web domain in 1992. You just can’t beat this kind of institutional legacy, and we’re confident that TechHive will use its new platform to reach many more people interested in home technology.\n\n\n\nSecond, in recent years PCWorld has made a deliberate push to expand its digital security content. And as digital security blends ever more closely with physical security, it just makes sense to fold TechHive’s smart home security content into PCWorld’s security story. So, please check out the new TechHive landing page for articles on security cameras, video doorbells, smart locks, smart lighting and more.\n\n\n\nYou’ll also find Jared Newman’s wildly popular Cord-Cutter Confidential column, along with other video streaming content that has helped define TechHive over the last seven years.\n\n\n\nThird, we’re relaunching the dormant TechHive YouTube channel! New videos have already gone live, and we’re planning for a steady stream of new product demos from CES 2025 in January.\n\n\n\nWe’ll be covering products and categories familiar to TechHive readers, while also expanding into more lifestyle-oriented home tech, plus health and wellness tech. We think this broader video vision is a great match for PCWorld, which has been speaking to early adopters throughout its 40-plus years of publishing.\n\n\n\nSo, once again, I invite you to check out the new TechHive hub. We’ve migrated much of TechHive security and streaming content to PCWorld already, and, going forward, all new TechHive content will appear on that page. Meanwhile, you can still access TechHive’s deep library of legacy content right here on this website.",

      "link": "https://www.techhive.com/article/579221/how-to-connect-a-soundbar-to-a-tv-without-hdmi-connectors.html",
      "contentSnippet": "While most modern soundbars rely on an HDMI cable to connect to HDTVs and 4K TVs, there are still plenty of soundbars on the market with legacy audio inputs that will work with older TVs—and yes, that includes many CRT (aka “tube”) TVs that are decades old.\n\n\n\nBy connecting an aging TV to a soundbar, you can give your older set a massive audio boost, complete with thumping bass and even virtualized 3D sound. And if your ancient flat-screen or tube TV has the right outputs, hooking it up to a new soundbar will be a snap.\n\n\n\nHere’s how to get started.\n\n\n\n1. Look for optical or RCA audio outputs\n\n\n\nThe first step is to check the back of your old TV to see what kind of audio outputs are available. If your aging TV lacks HDMI, the next best thing would be an optical (or Toslink) audio port, which has a squarish opening with a pair of small notches on each side. \n\n\n\nNot only can optical audio connections handle compressed (but not lossless) 5.1- and even 7.1-channel Dolby Digital and DTS sound, they’re also widely supported by the latest soundbars.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nMany older TVs have at least analog stereo RCA audio outputs or even a multi-channel optical digital audio output.\n\n\n\n\n\nNo sign of an optical output? Then look for a stereo pair of RCA audio outputs, one for the left channel (commonly white and marked “L”) and a second for the right channel (commonly red and marked “R”). \n\n\n\nMany older TVs—even those as far back as the 1980s—will have these familiar-looking RCA plugs situated on their rear input/output panels, which can deliver analog stereo audio signals.\n\n\n\n2. Pick the right soundbar\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve determined that your older TV has either optical or RCA analog audio outputs, you’re ready to go soundbar shopping—and, if we may be so bold, your first stop should be our roundup of the best soundbars, where we have reviews of the best soundbars at various price levels.\n\n\n\nAs you’re shopping, keep an eye out for soundbars that have audio inputs that match your TV’s outputs. If your set has an optical audio output, good news: soundbars with optical inputs are (as we mentioned earlier) easy to find. That said, there are more and more soundbars (particularly newer ones) that have only HDMI ports, so be sure to look carefully.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nYou’ll find plenty of soundbars on the market with optical and 3.5mm analog audio inputs that will work with older TVs.\n\n\n\n\n\nYou’ll see fewer current soundbars with an analog audio inputs than with optical connectors, but they’re still reasonably easy to find, particularly when it comes to budget soundbars in the sub-$200 range. \n\n\n\nWhat you’re looking for is a 3.5mm audio jack (generally labeled “AUX In”) that connects to the twin RCA connectors on your TV via a Y-shaped adapter cable (read on for help with picking the right cables).\n\n\n\n\nRelated: 10 things to consider when shopping for a soundbar\n\n\n\n\n3. Look for virtualized 3D sound modes\n\n\n\nBesides having the right connectors, you should also consider a soundbar with a virtual surround or 3D mode. Many of the latest soundbars have become remarkably adept at teasing surround and 3D audio–complete with height effects–out of 5.1- or even 2.0-channel audio sources. \n\n\n\nIn particular, DTS Virtual:X is impressively effective at tricking your ears into thinking they’re hearing sound from behind and even above your head, even when the original audio is only in stereo (which will be the case if your TV only has RCA-style analog audio outputs). And here’s the really good news: you can find DTS Virtual:X processing in soundbars that cost well south of $200.\n\n\n\n\nRelated: How virtual 3D audio is amping up the the latest soundbars\n\n\n\n\n4. Use the correct optical or 3.5mm-to-RCA cables\n\n\n\nOnce you’ve matched the optical and/or RCA-style audio outputs on your TV to the matching inputs on a soundbar, all you need to do is connect them using the proper cables. Most soundbar manufactures will include the proper optical cables (the ones that come with soundbars are generally quite short and thin) and RCA-to-3.5mm Y-cables.\n\n\n\nNo cables in the box? Don’t fret; both optical audio cables and RCA-to-3.5mm Y-cables are readily available through Amazon and other online retailers. Expect to spend about $15 or so for an optical cable, while RCA-to-3.5mm cables can be scooped up for less than $10.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nOptical audio cables and RCA-to-3.5mm Y-cables (pictured) are readily available on Amazon, typically for less than $10 each.\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Tweak your TV’s audio output settings\n\n\n\nYou might also need to make some adjustments to your TV’s audio settings. While some TVs may pipe sound through their audio-out ports automatically, others may require you to tinker with their audio settings Just start digging around in the TV’s settings menu.\n\n\n\nYou should also keep an eye out for a setting that switches your TV from “fixed” audio output (which will allow the soundbar to control the volume) to “variable” output (where the TV controls the volume). If the option exists, consider going for the “variable” setting, which means you won’t need to switch back and forth between your soundbar and TV remotes each time you want to adjust the volume.\n\n\n\nReady to shop for soundbars?

      "link": "https://www.techhive.com/article/582313/how-to-get-rid-of-hum-and-eliminate-other-noises-from-your-audio-and-video-systems.html",
      "contentSnippet": "So you just unboxed your new entertainment gear, hooked everything up, and you hear buzz, whine, hiss, chatter, or any number of other annoying noises that have been known to plague audio equipment. You might even see some banding or waves on your TV. So you take it all back to the store, only to watch the salesperson plug it in and have everything work perfectly. What’s going on here?\n\n\n\nYou might just need a simple ground loop isolator, like the $16 TII Network Technologies TII 220. Or if audible hum is your problem, the $80 EBTech Hum X will filter out the voltage in your ground line that’s causing it. Troubled by noise on your TV? An inexpensive ($10) Monoprice HDMI cable with a ferrite bead might do the trick. Yet another strategy is to plug all your gear into a line interactive uninterruptible power supply (UPS), such as the $250 Cyberpower CP1500PFCLCD. \n\n\nEliminate hum with the $80 EBTech HUM X\n\n\nOr you can bring out the big guns and power everything with a high-end isolation transformer. If a device like the $510 Tripplite IS1000HG can be trusted to protect and clean up the electricity feeding hospital equipment, it should be good enough for your home theater gear. \n\n\n\nThe problem could be bad wiring, defective equipment, or just a noisy electronic environment. Whatever the type of noise you’re hearing—and whatever the cause—we’ll help you identify it–and then show you how to get rid of it.\n\n\n\nCommon problem 1: Ground loops\n\n\n\nGround loops are the number-one cause of unusual audio noise and weird video, simply because it’s so darned easy to create. The most common manifestations are a loud buzz or hum coming through the speakers, or scrolling bands on a TV screen. It could also be a much quieter, yet equally annoying buzz or hum that you only hear when the room is otherwise quiet.\n\n\n\nA ground loop typically occurs when one or more pieces of your entertainment system are plugged into your home’s AC (alternating current) supply at different locations, and then connected together by electrical (versus optical) signal cables. RCA, HDMI, composite, component, and similar cables have shielding that’s connected to your home’s ground line. In the simplest terms, this creates a single-loop antenna that just loves to suck in various types of noise via electromagnetic induction. The illustration below shows how a ground loop can be created:\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tWhen you power inter-connected equipment from different AC outlets, you’re apt to create a ground loop: The ground will travel through the shielding of the signal cables.\n\n\n\n\nAnything that breaks the loop will remove the noise, and the easiest way to do it is to power everything through a single AC socket. As shown below, simply plug all your equipment into a single power strip, surge protector, or power center and plug that  into the wall. Problem solved. Most multimedia setups can be handled easily by a single 15-amp circuit.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tPowering connected equipment from the same AC socket will eliminate most ground loops. If you still get hum, see if your antenna or cable wire has its own ground connection.\n\n\n\n\nThere might be occasions where you simply can’t reach the same outlet with a piece of equipment. Self-powered speakers and subwoofers come to mind. You could just “pull the ground” by using a three-prong to two-prong adapter but this represents a potential shock hazard. Look up Les Harvey and Stone the Crows for an extreme example of what can happen with high-powered equipment.\n\n\nResolve coax cable ground loops with the $16 TII Network Technologies' TII 220\n\n\nIf an extension cord is impractical, a hum eliminator such as Ebtech’s Hum X should do the trick, and there are other products that do roughly the same thing, some of which interrupt the loop in the signal cables. If you have the skills, you can build your own hum eliminator for about $10 or $15. You’ll find plenty of information online that will show you how, but the task requires moderate skill with a soldering iron and similar tools.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\nEbtech’s Hum X eliminates ground loop noise safely. There are also DIY solutions online that are less expensive if you have the skills.\n\n\n\n\n\nIf those methods don’t fix things, the problem could be an over-the-air (OTA) antenna or a cable-TV coax cable that has its own path to ground. I’ve received some pretty annoying shocks when handling coax signal splitters. Normally—because of the isolation built into cable modems, cable boxes, and similar equipment—this will occur only if you’re connecting directly to the TV or to a video recorder.\n\n\n\nIf you’ve traced the problem to the TV signal wire that’s attached to a cable modem or similar (disconnect it and see if the problem goes away) replace that piece of equipment—there’s something wrong with it. If you’re connecting directly to a TV, there are ground-loop isolators available for less than $20.\n\n\n\nCommon problem 2: AC line noise\n\n\n\nGround loops are hardly the only thing that cause electrical noise; pretty much any device with a motor (hair dryers and blenders, for instance), as well as dimmer switches and failing fluorescent fixtures will create this type of interference. It might be audible through your audio equipment or visible on your TV, or it might not. The obvious solution for this type of noise is to not use those types of devices while you’re watching TV or listening to music. You might be able to make that work—if you live alone. If there are other people under the same roof, perhaps not. \n\n\nGet pristine AC power with a Tripp Lite SU1000XLCD UPS\n\n\nIf you’re willing to part with a few Benjamins, you can assure yourself of pristine AC without ground-loop noise by using a line interactive UPS (uninterruptible power supply) or an isolation transformer. A line interactive UPS is a battery-backup system with a battery that’s always engaged between the input AC and the output AC. This requires the electrical power to go through a conversion to DC (direct current) and then back to AC, which will remove all the noise. \n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tThis type of ground loop isolator, for coaxial cables used with over-the-air antennas and cable- and satellite-TV equipment, can eliminate both visual and audible noise.Amazon\n\n\n\nLine interactive UPSes are more expensive than the standby alternative, which keep switch to battery power on demand. Tripp Lite sent me its model SU1000XLCD UPS to clean up the super-dirty AC in my apartment. That device was selling for nearly $900 when I updated this article. It’s also heavy, about the size of a small dehumidifier, and it has some features (such as USB monitoring, so that it can gracefully shut down an attached computer in the event of a power failure) that have nothing to do with noise elimination. But darn if it isn’t 100 percent effective at providing protection against power surges and outages. The Tripp Lite IS1000HG isolation transformer I mentioned earlier will also clean up AC line noise. It costs several hundred dollars less, but doesn’t provide battery backup power.\n\n\nCondition your power with the Tripp Lite IS1000HG isolation transformer\n\n\nIt’s also much less-expensive than one of those high-end power conditioners you see marketed to gullible audiophiles. If you’re not worried about defeating ground-loop noise, you can get away for not much more than $100 with a UPS that advertises pure sine wave output.\n\n\n\nSlightly cheaper than an online UPS, but absolutely effective against all kinds of line noise is an isolation transformer. Tripplite sent me one of these as well: the excellent 1000-watt IS1000HG (Hospital Grade) with four outlets. It’s about $500, but you can easily get away with a lower wattage (500 or 250) model for less than $250. Note that I’ve seen much cheaper on Amazon, but not from a known vendor, so I can’t vouch for them.\n\n\n\nAn isolation transformer is one of those products whose name describes it to a tee—it employs a special, shielded transformer that turns dirty AC into clean AC via electromagnetic induction—yes, the same thing that causes ground-loop noise.\n\n\n\nIsolation transformers are designed for use with delicate diagnostic equipment, where even minimally noisy AC can cause spurious readings. That means they’re substantially more than adequate for multimedia setups.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tThe hospital-grade Tripp Lite IS1000HG isolation transformer is designed to eliminate any AC noise that could affect sensitive test equipment. Good enough for hospitals, good enough for your home theater.Tripp Lite\n\n\n\nCommon noise problem 3: Wires and cables\n\n\n\nThere are really only one or two hard and fast rules for cables and noise. The first is to never run a power cable across or near audio or video signal cables, including antenna wires. Modern signal cables are well shielded, but if you’re getting hum and it’s not a ground loop, this could well be the cause. Note that the cables running from a source device to self-powered speakers (i.e., not Wi-Fi or Bluetooth) are audio signal cables, not output cables.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tHDMI cables with ferrite beads filter the electronic signals traveling over the cable to block spurious current traveling through the cable’s shielding.Monoprice\n\n\n\nBalanced audio cables, meanwhile, consist of three wires: Two wires are used carry the signal instead of one, but the polarity of that signal is reversed on one wire. The third wire is used for grounding. This design renders balanced cables far less susceptible to power-cable hum and other electrical noises. If your equipment provides the option of using balanced cables–whether they be XLR or TRS (Tip/Ring/Sleeve)–take advantage of it.\n\n\n\nSpeaker cables have far stronger signals traveling along them, so they shouldn’t be as affected by RFI. But just to be safe, try to keep your AC cords isolated.\n\n\nKill HDMI noise with a $10 Monoprice cable with a ferrite bead\n\n\nThe other rule for wires is not looping antenna signal cables (twin-lead), which tends to induce the same noise by making them antennas themselves. Electromagnetic induction; it’s a blessing, it’s a curse (if you don’t know about it).\n\n\n\nAs to the quality of cables: A poorly made cable can cause noise issues, but there’s no real advantage to spending a fortune on them. A common misconception is that the more expensive the metal, the better the cable. Wrong. Gold is used on connectors because it doesn’t oxidize, not because it’s the best conductor of electricity. It’s quite good, better than nickel or chrome, but actually a bit worse than silver and copper. Forget platinum—it sounds sexy, but is about 20th down the conductivity list.\n\n\n\nCopper wire with gold connectors are the best combination; but again, don’t listen to the boutique audio sales propaganda. There are plenty of cables in the $10 to $20 range—or even lower—that will serve just as well.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tA line interactive uninterruptible power supply, like this CyberPower CP1500PFCLCD, continuously converts AC (alternating current) electrical power to DC (direct current) and then back to AC, removing all electrical noise in the process.Cyberpower\n\n\n\nOne thing you could check for, though it’s mostly an issue in high-impedance (higher gain/voltage, aka Hi-Z) applications, such as with guitar cables, is that they aren’t microphonic. Poor or loose shielding and other factors can actually turn physical shocks into audio signal. I’m not kidding. I’ve experienced this only once in my life with component-connecting cables and that was for a turntable. But if you’re noticing odd noises that seem to be in time with the bass or vibrations, give the signal cables a hard tap with a finger (with the equipment powered on) to see if this is a problem.\n\n\n\nOne more wire issue: size. While larger gauge wire can actually help an amp work a little easier and cooler when driving speakers by lowering cable impedance (resistivity), the impact on signal cables is negligible. That is, it’s inaudible to anyone who didn’t pay a lot for a fat wire and needs to hear a difference.\n\n\n\nCommon noise problem 4: RF interference\n\n\n\nEver wonder why the walls of your stereo receiver and other electronic devices are metal, when it seems like everything else in the world is made of plastic? It’s not for tensile strength, it’s to block incoming and outgoing RFI (radio frequency interference). Any conductive material tends to block RF signals and shunt their charge to its surface. Indeed, the shielding on cables works as a Faraday cage.\n\n\n\nSince it wouldn’t be practical to turn your home theater into Faraday cage, you should instead look to lessen the strength of the radio signals your A/V gear needs protection from. I’m talking portable phones, cell phones, Wi-Fi equipment, and even computers.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tThe red box in this photo identifies the balanced audio inputs on the back of a Yamaha HS-7 speaker. Many high-end DACs and audio interfaces have corresponding outputs. Balanced connections eliminate any noise induced into the signal traveling the cable.Yamaha\n\n\n\nComputers can generate a lot of RFI, which is why I shy away from cases with see-through plastic sides, which allow RFI to travel both ways. Wireless computer peripherals, such as mice and keyboards, can also cause interference. But if that happens, it’s a malfunction or bad design and the only fix is to replace them.\n\n\n\nBack to the point: Don’t be paranoid, but it’s not a bad idea to keep your RFI-emitting equipment as far away from your multimedia setup as you can. And if it’s a device that’s meant to be near your setup, make sure it’s adequately shielded.\n\n\n\nCommon noise problem 5: USB/HDMI cable noise\n\n\n\nI use external USB and Thunderbolt audio interfaces because they sound a lot better than anything you’ll find on a PC motherboard. Believe me: if my old ears can hear the difference, there is one. But when I first started using such gear, I would occasionally hear very faint static. For rather complicated reasons, current can leak into the shielding of USB cables which affects the signal. It’s annoying.\n\n\n\nThere are three methods for removing USB (and HDMI) cable noise. One is to use a cable with a ferrite noise suppressor sleeve (a slug of iron molded around the cable). You can also buy clip-on ferrite noise suppressors. These are sometimes called a ferrite bead.\n\n\n\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\n\t\tYou can modify your own audio and video cables to render them more noise proof by adding ferrite beads. This 10-pack costs about $13 at Amazon.VSKEY\n\n\n\nThe second method is to run a wire that’s less resistive than the USB/HDMI cable shielding from the case of the USB audio interface or HDMI audio component to your computer’s case. Speaker wire works fine for this. Electricity always follows the path of least resistance, so spurious current runs down the ground wire rather than the cable’s shield. This is also known as a ground shunt, or simply a shunt.\n\n\n\nThe third method is to get a USB noise filter (I’ve never seen one for HDMI, but an HDMI adapter could work), which is actually a USB re-transmitter that splits the shield connection. These cost around $50 and are said to indeed eliminate the noise. I’ve never used one, because the first and second methods are far cheaper and have never failed me.\n\n\nKill cable noise by attaching ferrite beads\n\n\nCommon noise problem 6: PC audio noise\n\n\n\nThe other reason I use external USB and Thunderbolt interfaces is that they simply aren’t subjected to as much RFI. Internal audio solutions, especially those that reside on a computer’s motherboard, are susceptible to all sorts of line noise and electromagnetic interference that can’t be eliminated. As you might have noticed, I just gave you the solution—go external USB or Thunderbolt. That said, there are PCI and PCIe cards that might also eliminate the problem, as well provide more outputs for gaming and surround.\n\n\n\nThe only good noise is the joyful noise you make\n\n\n\nAny combination of the approaches shown above should eliminate all the noise that’s not inherent in your audio system, as well as some you might have thought was inherent. But if you’re suffering a type of noise that I haven’t covered, or have a home-brew fix that works, please share it with us by leaving a comment on our Facebook page and/or emailing me at letters@techhive.com.\n\n\nSign up for the weekly Best of TechHive newsletter",

      "link": "http://security.googleblog.com/2024/12/google-cloud-expands-vulnerability.html",
      "contentSnippet": "Posted by Greg Mucci, Product Manager, Artifact Analysis, Oliver Chang, Senior Staff Engineering, OSV, and Charl de Nysschen, Product Manager OSVDevOps teams dedicated to securing their supply chain and predicting potential risks consistently face novel threats. Fortunately, they can now improve their image and container security by harnessing Google-grade vulnerability scanning, which offers expanded open-source coverage. A significant benefit of utilizing Google Cloud Platform is its integrated security tools, including Artifact Analysis. This scanning service leverages the same infrastructure that Google depends on to monitor vulnerabilities within its internal systems and software supply chains.Artifact Analysis has recently expanded its scanning coverage to eight additional language packages, four operating systems, and two extensively utilized base images, making it a more robust and versatile tool than ever before.   This enhanced coverage was achieved by integrating Artifact Analysis with the Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) platform and database. This integration provides industry-leading insights into open source vulnerabilities—a crucial capability as software supply chain attacks continue to grow in frequency and complexity, impacting organizations reliant on open source software.With these recent updates, customers can now successfully scan the vast majority of the images they push to Artifact Registry. These successful scans ensure that any known vulnerabilities are detected, reported, and can be integrated into a broader vulnerability management program, allowing teams to take prompt action.Open source vulnerabilities, with more reach Artifact Analysis pulls vulnerability information directly from OSV, which is the only open source, distributed vulnerability database that gets information directly from open source practitioners. OSV’s database provides a consistent, high quality, high fidelity database of vulnerabilities from authoritative sources who have adopted the OSV schema. This ensures the database has accurate information to reliably match software dependencies to known vulnerabilities—previously a difficult process reliant on inaccurate mechanisms such as CPEs (Common Platform Enumerations). Over the past three years, OSV has increased its total coverage to 28 language and OS ecosystems. For example, industry leaders such as GitHub, Chainguard, and Ubuntu, as well as open source ecosystems such as Rust and Python are now exporting their vulnerability discoveries in the OSV Schema. This increased coverage also includes Chainguard’s Wolfi images and Google’s Distroless images, which are popular choices for minimal container images used by many developers and organizations. Customers who rely on distroless images can count on Artifact Analysis scanning to support their minimal container image initiatives.  Each expansion in OSV’s coverage is incorporated into scanning tools that integrate with the OSV database.Broader vulnerability detection with Artifact Analysis As a result of OSV’s expansion, scanners like Artifact Analysis that draw from OSV now alert users to higher quality vulnerability information across a broader set of ecosystems—meaning GCP project owners will be made aware of a more complete set of vulnerability findings and potential security risks. Existing Artifact Registry scanning customers don't need to take any action to take advantage of this update. Projects that have scanning enabled will immediately benefit from this expanded coverage and vulnerability findings will continue to be available in the Artifact Registry UI, Container Analysis API, and via pub/sub (for workflows).Existing On Demand scanning customers will also benefit from this expanded vulnerability coverage. All the same Operating Systems and Language package coverage that Registry Scanning customers enjoy are available in On Demand Scan. Beyond Artifact Registry We know that detection is just one of the first steps necessary to manage risks. We’re continually expanding Artifact Analysis capabilities and in 2025 we’ll be integrating Artifact Registry vulnerability findings with Google Cloud’s Security Command Center. Through Security Command Center customers can maintain a more comprehensive vulnerability management program, and prioritize risk across a number of different dimensions. ",

      "title": "Announcing the launch of Vanir: Open-source Security Patch Validation",
      "link": "http://security.googleblog.com/2024/12/announcing-launch-of-vanir-open-source.html",
      "contentSnippet": "Posted by Hyunwook Baek, Duy Truong, Justin Dunlap and Lauren Stan from Android Security and Privacy, and Oliver Chang with the Google Open Source Security TeamToday, we are announcing the availability of Vanir, a new open-source security patch validation tool. Introduced at Android Bootcamp in April, Vanir gives Android platform developers the power to quickly and efficiently scan their custom platform code for missing security patches and identify applicable available patches. Vanir significantly accelerates patch validation by automating this process, allowing OEMs to ensure devices are protected with critical security updates much faster than traditional methods. This strengthens the security of the Android ecosystem, helping to keep Android users around the world safe. By open-sourcing Vanir, we aim to empower the broader security community to contribute to and benefit from this tool, enabling wider adoption and ultimately improving security across various ecosystems. While initially designed for Android, Vanir can be easily adapted to other ecosystems with relatively small modifications, making it a versatile tool for enhancing software security across the board. In collaboration with the Google Open Source Security Team, we have incorporated feedback from our early adopters to improve Vanir and make it more useful for security professionals. This tool is now available for you to start developing on top of, and integrating into, your systems.The Android ecosystem relies on a multi-stage process for vulnerability mitigation. When a new vulnerability is discovered, upstream AOSP developers create and release upstream patches. The downstream device and chip manufacturers then assess the impact on their specific devices and backport the necessary fixes. This process, while effective, can present scalability challenges, especially for manufacturers managing a diverse range of devices and old models with complex update histories. Managing patch coverage across diverse and customized devices often requires considerable effort due to the manual nature of backporting.To streamline the vital security workflow, we developed Vanir. Vanir provides a scalable and sustainable solution for security patch adoption and validation, helping to ensure Android devices receive timely protection against potential threats.The power of VanirSource-code-based static analysis Vanir’s first-of-its-kind approach to Android security patch validation uses source-code-based static analysis to directly compare the target source code against known vulnerable code patterns. Vanir does not rely on traditional metadata-based validation mechanisms, such as version numbers, repository history and build configs, which can be prone to errors. This unique approach enables Vanir to analyze entire codebases with full history, individual files, or even partial code snippets. A main focus of Vanir is to automate the time consuming and costly process of identifying missing security patches in the open source software ecosystem. During the early development of Vanir, it became clear that manually identifying a high-volume of missing patches is not only labor intensive but also can leave user devices inadvertently exposed to known vulnerabilities for a period of time. To address this, Vanir utilizes novel automatic signature refinement techniques and multiple pattern analysis algorithms, inspired by the vulnerable code clone detection algorithms proposed by Jang et al. [1] and Kim et al. [2]. These algorithms have low false-alarm rates and can effectively handle broad classes of code changes that might appear in code patch processes. In fact, based on our 2-year operation of Vanir, only 2.72% of signatures triggered  false alarms. This allows Vanir to efficiently find missing patches, even with code changes, while minimizing unnecessary alerts and manual review efforts. Vanir's source-code-based approach also enables rapid scaling across any ecosystem. It can generate signatures for any source files written in supported languages. Vanir's signature generator automatically generates, tests, and refines these signatures, allowing users to quickly create signatures for new vulnerabilities in any ecosystem simply by providing source files with security patches. Android’s successful use of Vanir highlights its efficiency compared to traditional patch verification methods. A single engineer used Vanir to generate signatures for over 150 vulnerabilities and verify missing security patches across its downstream branches – all within just five days.Vanir for AndroidCurrently Vanir supports C/C++ and Java targets and covers 95% of Android kernel and userspace CVEs with public security patches. Google Android Security team consistently incorporates the latest CVEs into Vanir’s coverage to provide a complete picture of the Android ecosystem’s patch adoption risk profile. The Vanir signatures for Android vulnerabilities are published through the Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) database. This allows Vanir users to seamlessly protect their codebases against latest Android vulnerabilities without any additional updates. Currently, there are over 2,000 Android vulnerabilities in OSV, and finishing scanning an entire Android source tree can take 10-20 minutes with a modern PC.Flexible integration, adoption and expansion.Vanir is developed not only as a standalone application but also as a Python library. Users who want to integrate automated patch verification processes with their continuous build or test chain may easily achieve it by wiring their build integration tool with Vanir scanner libraries. For instance, Vanir is integrated with a continuous testing pipeline in Google, ensuring all security patches are adopted in ever-evolving Android codebase and their first-party downstream branches.Vanir is also fully open-sourced, and under BSD-3 license. As Vanir is not fundamentally limited to the Android ecosystem, you may easily adopt Vanir for the ecosystem that you want to protect by making relatively small modifications in Vanir. In addition, since Vanir’s underlying algorithm is not limited to security patch validation, you may modify the source and use it for different purposes such as licensed code detection or code clone detection. The Android Security team welcomes your contributions to Vanir for any direction that may expand its capability and scope. You can also contribute to Vanir by providing vulnerability data with Vanir signatures to OSV.Vanir ResultsSince early last year, we have partnered with several Android OEMs to test the tool’s effectiveness. Internally we have been able to integrate the tool into our build system continuously testing against over 1,300 vulnerabilities. Currently Vanir covers 95% of all Android, Wear, and Pixel vulnerabilities with public fixes across Android Kernel and Userspace. It has a 97% accuracy rate, which has saved our internal teams over 500 hours to date in patch fix time.Next stepsWe are happy to announce that Vanir is now available for public use. Vanir is not technically limited to Android, and we are also actively exploring problems that Vanir may help address, such as general C/C++ dependency management via integration with OSV-scanner. If you are interested in using or contributing to Vanir, please visit github.com/google/vanir. Please join our public community to submit your feedback and questions on the tool. We look forward to working with you on Vanir!",

      "contentSnippet": "Ready to give your streaming video setup a boost? There’s no better time than Cyber Monday to trade up for a new and improved streaming video player, and we’ve spotted some enticing deals on streaming devices from Amazon and Roku.\n\n\n\nAmazon is serving up deals on its latest streaming devices, including the just-released Fire TV Stick HD and Fire TV Stick 4K, while Roku is offering discounts on its popular Streaming Stick 4K, Express 4K+, and more.\n\n\n\nWe’re also keeping an eye out for Cyber Monday deals for the Apple TV 4K, Nvidia Shield, and Google Chromecast (including the new Google TV Streamer). We’ll update our list as more deals go live.\n\n\n\nUpdated December 2, 2024: We’ve added the latest streaming video player deals. Also, be sure to check out Cyber Monday discounts on home security cameras, video doorbells, Philips Hue smart lights, and more! \n\n\n\nBest Black Friday deals on Amazon Fire TV streaming players\n\n\n\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick HD, $17.99 on Amazon (49% off)\n\n\n\nAmazon Fire TV Stick 4K, $21.99 on Amazon (56% off)\n\n\n\nAmazon Fire TV Cube (3rd gen), $99.99 on Amazon (29% off)\n\n\n\n\nBoth the Amazon Fire TV Stick HD and the Fire Stick 4K were released barely a month ago, meaning the latest generations of those streaming players are already getting big Black Friday discounts (particularly the Fire TV Stick 4K). \n\n\n\nYou can also nab a solid deal on the Fire TV Cube, which is capable of controlling your cable box with voice commands (courtesy of Alexa).\n\n\n\nBest Black Friday deals on Roku streaming players\n\n\n\n\nRoku Express 4K+, $24 on Amazon (40% off)\n\n\n\nRoku Streaming Stick 4K, $29 on Amazon (42% off)\n\n\n\nRoku Ultra LT, $57 on Amazon (19% off)\n\n\n\nRoku Ultra (2024), $79 on Amazon (21% off)\n\n\n\nRoku Streambar SE, $69 on Amazon (31% off)\n\n\n\n\nJust $24 for the Roku Express 4K+ streamer is a terrific price, while the discounted Roku Streaming Stick 4K ups the ante with Dolby Vision support for just five bucks more. \n\n\n\nMeanwhile, Roku’s top-of-the-line Ultra–now with a backlit remote–is getting a Black Friday price cut, or you can opt for the Ultra LT, which shaves off a few features (namely a USB port) and includes a more basic remote for even less. \n\n\n\nFinally, the Roku Streambar SE is a compact soundbar with a built-in Roku streaming player, and it’s priced to move for Black Friday.\n\n\n\nIt’s worth noting that we skipped Roku’s cheapest players, the Roku LE and the Roku Express. As our columnist Jared Newman noted, they’re simply not very good players for the price, and you can do much better spending just a few dollars more for our picks.\n\n\n\n Black Friday streaming player deals: What you need to know \n1.\nWhen is Black Friday?\n\n\n\n\nPerhaps the biggest shopping day in the U.S., Black Friday lands on the day after Thanksgiving–and this year, the big day comes on November 29, 2024.\n\n\n\nOf course, Black Friday deals will start popping up well before the actual day, and they’ll generally continue through the weekend, leading up to Cyber Monday. \n\n\n\n\n\n2.\nWhat is Cyber Monday? \n\n\n\n\nA relatively new addition to the end-of-the-year shopping season, Cyber Monday hits the first Monday after Black Friday. For 2024, that means Monday, December 2.\n\n\n\nThe idea behind Cyber Monday was that it was a day of discounts for online shoppers, versus the in-person shopping spree that Black Friday used to be. Now, both shopping days are mostly about pointing and clicking.\n\n\n\n\n\n3.\nWill there be streaming video player deals on Black Friday and Cyber Monday?\n\n\n\n\nMost definitely, with Amazon and Roku generally serving up the most streaming video deals.\n\n\n\nWe also expect to see discounts on Google’s Chromecast players, while on rare occasions, Apple and Nvidia will cut prices on their Apple TV 4K and Nvidia Shield devices.\n\n\n\n\n\n4.\nDo you have to be an Amazon Prime member to get Black Friday discounts?\n\n\n\n\nUnlike Prime Day, most Black Friday deals on Amazon are open to all shoppers, although you’ll need to be a Prime member to get free shipping. Amazon discloses which deals are limited to Prime members.\n\n\n\nYou can get Amazon Prime for $14.99 a month, or $139 a year, and your membership includes a variety of benefits, including free shipping for Prime items, access to Prime Video, Amazon Music, Prime Reading, and more.\n\n\n\nNaturally, Prime isn’t needed when shopping at non-Amazon retailers, such as Best Buy, Target, and Walmart.\n\n\n\n\n\n5.\nSpeaking of which, will other retailers offer their own Black Friday discounts? \n\n\n\n\nOf course! Be sure to keep an eye on Best Buy, Target, Walmart, and other online stores as Black Friday and Cyber Monday progress.",

\n Posted by Ivan Fratric, Google Project Zero\n Recently, one of the projects I was involved in had to do with video decoding on Apple platforms, specifically AV1 decoding. On Apple devices that support AV1 video format (starting from Apple A17 iOS / M3 macOS), decoding is done in hardware. However, despite this, during decoding, a large part of the AV1 format parsing happens in software, inside the kernel, more specifically inside the AppleAVD kernel extension (or at least, that used to be the case in macOS 14/ iOS 17). As fuzzing is one of the techniques we employ regularly, the question of how to effectively fuzz this code inevitably came up.\n \n It should be noted that I wasn’t the first person to look into the problem of Apple kernel extension fuzzing, so before going into the details of my approach, other projects in this space should be mentioned.\n \n In the Fairplay research project, @pwn0rz utilized a custom loader to load the kernel extension into userspace. A coworker tried to run this code on the current AppleAVD extension, however it didn’t work for them (at least not out of the box) so we didn’t end up using it. It should be noted here that my approach also loads the kernel code into userspace, albeit in a more lightweight way.\n \n In the Cinema time! presentation at Hexacon 2022, Andrey Labunets and Nikita Tarakanov presented their approach for fuzzing AppleAVD where the decompiled code was first extracted using IDA and then rebuilt. I used this approach in the past in some more constrained scenarios, however the decompiled code from IDA is not perfect and manual fixing was often required (such as, for example, when IDA would get the stack layout of a function incorrectly).\n \n In the KextFuzz project, Tingting Yin with the co-authors statically instrumented kernel extensions by replacing pointer authentication instructions with a jump to a coverage-collecting trampoline, which results in a partial coverage.\n \n Most recently, the Pishi project by Meysam Firouzi was released just before this research. The project statically instruments kernel extension code by using Ghidra to identify all basic blocks, and then replacing one instruction from each basic block with a branch to a dedicated trampoline. The trampoline records the coverage, executes the replaced instruction and jumps back to the address of the next instruction. This was reported to run on a real device.\n \n Given the existence of these other projects, it is worth saying that my goal was not to create necessarily the “best” method for kernel extension fuzzing, but what for me was the simplest (if we don’t count the underlying complexity of the off-the shelf tools being used). In short, my approach, that will be discussed in detail in other sections, was\n Load AppleAVD extension or full kernelcache into IDARebase the module to an address that can be reliably allocated in userspaceExport raw memory using an IDA Python scriptLoad exported bytes using custom loaderUse custom TinyInst module to hook and instrument the extensionUse Jackalope for fuzzing\n \n All the project code can be found here. Various components will be explained in more detail throughout the rest of the blog post.Extracting kernel extension code\n Normally, on macOS, kernel extensions are packaged inside “kernel collections” files that serve as containers for multiple extensions. At first OS boot (and whenever something is changed with regards to kernel extensions), the kernel extensions needed by the machine are repackaged into what is called the “kernel cache” (kernelcache file on the filesystem). Kernel extensions can be extracted from these caches and collections, but existing tooling can’t really produce individual .dylib files that can be loaded into userspace and run without issues.\n \n However, reverse engineering tooling, specifically IDA Pro which I used in this research, comes with a surprisingly good loader for Apple kernel cache. I haven’t tried how other reverse engineering tools compare, but if they are comparable and someone would like to contribute to the project, I would gladly accept export scripts for these other tools.\n \n So, instead of writing our own loader, we can simply piggyback on IDA’s. The idea is simple:we let IDA load the kernel extension we want (or even the entire kernelcache)we use IDA to rebase the code so it’s in memory range that is mappable in userspace (see image)using a simple IDA Python script, we export for each memory segment its start address, end address, protection flags and raw bytesoptionally, we can also, using the same script, export all the symbol names and the corresponding addresses so we can later refer to symbols by name\n \n The following image shows rebasing of the kernel extension. This functionality is accessible in IDA via Edit- >Segments- >Rebase program… menu. When choosing the new base address, it is convenient to only change the high bits which makes it easy to manually convert rebased to original addresses and vice versa when needed. In the example below the image base was changed from 0xFFFFFE000714C470 to  0xAB0714C470.\n \n \n Figure 1: Rebasing the extension\n \n The IDA script for exporting the data can be found here. You can run it using the following commands in IDA:\n \n sys.path.append('/directory/containing/export/script')\n import segexport\n segexport.export('/path/to/output/file)Loading and running\n Loading the exported data should now be only the matter of memory mapping the correct addresses and copying the corresponding data from the exported file. You can see it in the load() function here.\n \n However, since we are now loading and running kernel code in userspace, there will be functions that won’t run well or that we would want to change. One example for this are the kernel allocator functions that we’ll want to replace with the system malloc.\n \n One way of replacing these functions would be to rewrite the prolog of each function we want to replace with a jump to its replacement. However, since we will later be using TinyInst to extract code coverage, there is a simpler way. We will simply write a breakpoint instruction to each function we want to replace. Since TinyInst is (among other things) a debugger, it will catch each of these breakpoints and, from the TinyInst process, we can replace the instruction pointer with the address of the corresponding replacement function. More details on this can be found in the next section.\n \n Besides replacing the memory allocation functions, logging functions etc., we will also need to replace all functions that interact with the hardware that we can’t access from userspace (or, in our case, that isn’t even present on the machine). In the case of AV1 parsing code in the AppleAVD kernel extension, a function called AppleAVD::sendCommandToCommandGate gets called, which I assume is meant to communicate with the decoding hardware. Thus, as a part of the harness, this function was replaced with a function that always returns 0 (success).\n \n The final code of the AV1 harness code can be found here. It can be compiled as\n \n clang++ loader.cpp avdharness.cpp -oloader\n \n and might need some additional entitlements to run which can be applied with\n \n codesign --entitlements entitlements.txt -f -s - ./loader\n \n Note that, in the harness code, although I tried to rely on symbol names instead of hardcoded offsets wherever possible, it still contains some struct offsets. This version of the harness was based on macos 14.5 kernel, which was the most recent OS version at the time the loader was written.Writing a custom TinyInst module\n This section explains the custom TinyInst module that accompanies the loader (and is required for the correct functioning of the loader). This code doesn’t contain anything specific for a particular kernel extension and thus can be reused as is. If you are not interested in how it works or writing custom TinyInst modules, then you can skip this section.\n \n Firstly, since we will want to extract code coverage for the purposes of fuzzing, we will base our custom module on LiteCov, the “default” TinyInst module for code coverage:\n \n class AVDInst : public LiteCov {\n   …\n };\n \n Secondly, we need a way for our custom loader to communicate with the TinyInst moduleIt needs to tell TinyInst which functions in the kext should be replaced with which replacement functions.It needs to tell TinyInst where the kext was loaded so that TinyInst can instrument it.\n \n While TinyInst provides an API for function hooking that we could use here, there is also a more direct (albeit, also more low-level) way. From our loader, we will simply call a function at some hardcoded non-mapped address. This will, once again, cause an exception that TinyInst (being a debugger) will catch, read the parameters from registers, do the required action and “return” (by replacing the instruction pointer with the value inside the link register). The loader uses the hardcoded address 0x747265706C616365 to register a replacement and 0x747265706C616366 to tell TinyInst about the address range to instrument:\n \n #define TINYINST_REGISTER_REPLACEMENT 0x747265706C616365\n #define TINYINST_CUSTOM_INSTRUMENT 0x747265706C616366\n \n We can catch those in the exception handler of our custom module\n \n bool AVDInst::OnException(Exception *exception_record) {\n   …\n   if(exception_address == TINYINST_REGISTER_REPLACEMENT) {\n     RegisterReplacementHook();\n     return true;\n   }\n \n   if(exception_address == TINYINST_CUSTOM_INSTRUMENT) {\n     InstrumentCustomRange();\n     return true;\n   }\n   …\n }\n \n and then read the parameters and do the required action\n \n void AVDInst::RegisterReplacementHook() {\n   uint64_t original_address = GetRegister(X0);\n   uint64_t replacement_address = GetRegister(X1);\n \n   redirects[original_address] = replacement_address;\n \n   SetRegister(ARCH_PC, GetRegister(LR));\n }\n \n void AVDInst::InstrumentCustomRange() {\n   uint64_t min_address = GetRegister(X0);\n   uint64_t max_address = GetRegister(X1);\n \n   InstrumentAddressRange(\"__custom_range__\", min_address, max_address);\n \n   SetRegister(ARCH_PC, GetRegister(LR));\n }\n \n Where InstrumentAddressRange is a recently added TinyInst function that will instrument all code between addresses given in its parameters. “__custom_range__” is simply a name that we give to this region of memory so we can differentiate between multiple instrumented modules (if there are more than one).\n \n Next, TinInst needs to perform the actual function replacements. As explained above, this can be done in the exception handler of our module.\n \n   auto iter = redirects.find(exception_address);\n   if(iter != redirects.end()) {\n     // printf(\"Redirecting...n\");\n     SetRegister(ARCH_PC, iter- >second);\n     return true;\n   }\n \n This is mostly sufficient for running the kernel extension without instrumenting it (e.g. to collect coverage). However, if we also want to instrument the extension, then the process of instrumentation involves rewriting the extension code in another location and inserting e.g. additional instructions to record coverage. The consequence of this is that our breakpoint instructions (that we inserted for the purpose of redirects) will be rewritten at different addresses. We need to make TinyInst aware of this (as a side note, TinyInst Hook API does this under the hood, but it wasn’t used in this module). We can do this in the InstrumentInstruction function which gets called for every instruction as it’s being instrumented:\n \n InstructionResult AVDInst::InstrumentInstruction(ModuleInfo *module,\n                                         Instruction& inst,\n                                         size_t bb_address,\n                                         size_t instruction_address)\n {\n   auto iter = redirects.find(instruction_address);\n   if(iter != redirects.end()) {\n     instrumented_redirects[assembler_- >Breakpoint(module)] = iter- >second;\n     return INST_STOPBB;\n   }\n \n   return LiteCov::InstrumentInstruction(module, inst, bb_address, instruction_address);\n }\n \n The INST_STOPBB return value tells TinyInst to stop processing the current basic blocks. Since on breakpoints/redirects, we redirect the execution to another function, no other instructions from the same basic block ever get executed and are thus unneeded.\n \n After this, we now know the addresses of breakpoints (and the corresponding replacements) in both instrumented and non-instrumented code. The final exception handler of our custom module looks like this:\n \n bool AVDInst::OnException(Exception *exception_record) {\n   size_t exception_address;\n \n   if(exception_record- >type == BREAKPOINT)\n   {\n     exception_address = (size_t)exception_record- >ip;\n   } else if(exception_record- >type == ACCESS_VIOLATION) {\n     exception_address = (size_t)exception_record- >access_address;\n   } else {\n     return LiteCov::OnException(exception_record);\n   }\n \n   if(exception_address == TINYINST_REGISTER_REPLACEMENT) {\n     RegisterReplacementHook();\n     return true;\n   }\n \n   if(exception_address == TINYINST_CUSTOM_INSTRUMENT) {\n     InstrumentCustomRange();\n     return true;\n   }\n \n   auto iter = redirects.find(exception_address);\n   if(iter != redirects.end()) {\n     // printf(\"Redirecting...n\");\n     SetRegister(ARCH_PC, iter- >second);\n     return true;\n   }\n \n   iter = instrumented_redirects.find(exception_address);\n   if(iter != instrumented_redirects.end()) {\n     // printf(\"Redirecting...n\");\n     SetRegister(ARCH_PC, iter- >second);\n     return true;\n   }\n \n   return LiteCov::OnException(exception_record);\n }\n \n The entire code, with all the housekeeping functions can be found here.Fuzzing and findings\n Once our custom module is ready, we still need to make sure TinyInst and Jackalope will use this module instead of the default LiteCov module. See the appropriate patches for TinyInst and Jackalope.\n \n Our harness should now run correctly under TinyInst, both without and with coverage instrumentation:\n \n ./Jackalope/build/TinyInst/Release/litecov -- ./loader avd_rebased.dat -f \n \n Where avd_rebased.dat contains the kernel extension code exported from IDA. We can also add the -trace_basic_blocks flag to trace basic blocks as they are being executed (primarily useful for debugging). We can also run a fuzzing session with Jackalope like this:\n \n ./Jackalope/build/Release/fuzzer -in in -out out -t 1000 -delivery shmem -target_module loader -target_method __Z4fuzzPc -nargs 1 -iterations 5000 -persist -loop -cmp_coverage -mute_child -nthreads 6 -- ./loader avd_rebased.dat -m @@\n \n This tells jackalope to run in persistent mode (with the function “fuzz” being looped), with sample delivery over shared memory (-delivery shmem fuzzer flag and -m being implemented in the harness code).\n \n Fuzzing is useful not only for finding bugs in the target, but in our case also for finding bugs in the harness, e.g. finding other kernel functions we need to replace in order for the target to work correctly.\n \n After several iterations of fixups, the harness appeared to be working correctly. However, the fuzzer also caught some crashes that appeared to have been caused by genuine issues in the AV1 parsing code. I did a root cause analysis and reported the issues to Apple. The reports can be seen in the following entries in the Project Zero issue tracker:\n AppleAVD: Large OBU size in AV1_Syntax::Parse_Header reading to out-of-bounds readsAppleAVD: Issue with AV1_Syntax::f leading to out-of-bounds readsAppleAVD: Integer underflow in AV1_Syntax::Parse_Header leading to out-of-bounds reads\n \n Unfortunately, at the time of reporting these issues I still didn’t have access to a machine with AV1 decoding capabilities. Thus, instead of full end-to-end PoCs, the issues were reported in the form of a full root cause analysis and a binary stream that causes a crash when used as a parameter to a particular decoding function. Eventually, we did get a Macbook with a M3 chip that supports AV1 hardware decoding and tried to reproduce the reported issues. Unsurprisingly, all three issues reproduced exactly the same on the real hardware as in the userspace harness.Conclusion\n The goal of this project was to create userspace kernel extension fuzzing tooling that was as simple as possible, and at least one of the reasons for this simplicity was that it could be easily adapted to other pieces of kernel code. The process is versatile enough that it allowed us to fuzz AV1 parsing code that normally requires hardware we didn’t even have at the time. While the three issues found during this research are not critical, they demonstrate the correctness of the approach and the potential for finding other issues.",

      "contentSnippet": "Posted by Oliver Chang, Dongge Liu and Jonathan Metzman, Google Open Source Security TeamRecently, OSS-Fuzz reported 26 new vulnerabilities to open source project maintainers, including one vulnerability in the critical OpenSSL library (CVE-2024-9143) that underpins much of internet infrastructure. The reports themselves aren’t unusual—we’ve reported and helped maintainers fix over 11,000 vulnerabilities in the 8 years of the project. But these particular vulnerabilities represent a milestone for automated vulnerability finding: each was found with AI, using AI-generated and enhanced fuzz targets. The OpenSSL CVE is one of the first vulnerabilities in a critical piece of software that was discovered by LLMs, adding another real-world example to a recent Google discovery of an exploitable stack buffer underflow in the widely used database engine SQLite.This blog post discusses the results and lessons over a year and a half of work to bring AI-powered fuzzing to this point, both in introducing AI into fuzz target generation and expanding this to simulate a developer’s workflow. These efforts continue our explorations of how AI can transform vulnerability discovery and strengthen the arsenal of defenders everywhere.The story so farIn August 2023, the OSS-Fuzz team announced AI-Powered Fuzzing, describing our effort to leverage large language models (LLM) to improve fuzzing coverage to find more vulnerabilities automatically—before malicious attackers could exploit them. Our approach was to use the coding abilities of an LLM to generate more fuzz targets, which are similar to unit tests that exercise relevant functionality to search for vulnerabilities. The ideal solution would be to completely automate the manual process of developing a fuzz target end to end:Drafting an initial fuzz target.Fixing any compilation issues that arise. Running the fuzz target to see how it performs, and fixing any obvious mistakes causing runtime issues.Running the corrected fuzz target for a longer period of time, and triaging any crashes to determine the root cause.Fixing vulnerabilities. In August 2023, we covered our efforts to use an LLM to handle the first two steps. We were able to use an iterative process to generate a fuzz target with a simple prompt including hardcoded examples and compilation errors. In January 2024, we open sourced the framework that we were building to enable an LLM to generate fuzz targets. By that point, LLMs were reliably generating targets that exercised more interesting code coverage across 160 projects. But there was still a long tail of projects where we couldn’t get a single working AI-generated fuzz target.To address this, we’ve been improving the first two steps, as well as implementing steps 3 and 4.New results: More code coverage and discovered vulnerabilitiesWe’re now able to automatically gain more coverage in 272 C/C++ projects on OSS-Fuzz (up from 160), adding 370k+ lines of new code coverage. The top coverage improvement in a single project was an increase from 77 lines to 5434 lines (a 7000% increase).This led to the discovery of 26 new vulnerabilities in projects on OSS-Fuzz that already had hundreds of thousands of hours of fuzzing. The highlight is CVE-2024-9143 in the critical and well-tested OpenSSL library. We reported this vulnerability on September 16 and a fix was published on October 16. As far as we can tell, this vulnerability has likely been present for two decades and wouldn’t have been discoverable with existing fuzz targets written by humans.Another example was a bug in the project cJSON, where even though an existing human-written harness existed to fuzz a specific function, we still discovered a new vulnerability in that same function with an AI-generated target. One reason that such bugs could remain undiscovered for so long is that line coverage is not a guarantee that a function is free of bugs. Code coverage as a metric isn’t able to measure all possible code paths and states—different flags and configurations may trigger different behaviors, unearthing different bugs. These examples underscore the need to continue to generate new varieties of fuzz targets even for code that is already fuzzed, as has also been shown by Project Zero in the past (1, 2).New improvementsTo achieve these results, we’ve been focusing on two major improvements:Automatically generate more relevant context in our prompts. The more complete and relevant information we can provide the LLM about a project, the less likely it would be to hallucinate the missing details in its response. This meant providing more accurate, project-specific context in prompts, such as function, type definitions, cross references, and existing unit tests for each project. To generate this information automatically, we built new infrastructure to index projects across OSS-Fuzz. LLMs turned out to be highly effective at emulating a typical developer’s entire workflow of writing, testing, and iterating on the fuzz target, as well as triaging the crashes found. Thanks to this, it was possible to further automate more parts of the fuzzing workflow. This additional iterative feedback in turn also resulted in higher quality and greater number of correct fuzz targets. The workflow in actionOur LLM can now execute the first four steps of the developer’s process (with the fifth soon to come). 1. Drafting an initial fuzz targetA developer might check the source code, existing documentation and unit tests, as well as  usages of the target function when to draft an initial fuzz target. An LLM can fulfill this role here, if we provide a prompt with this information and ask it to come up with a fuzz target. Prompt: Your goal is to write a fuzzing harness for the provided function-under-test signature using LLVMFuzzerTestOneInput. It is important that the provided solution compiles and actually calls the function-under-test specified by the function signature:unsigned char * buffer_append_base64_decode(buffer *, const char *, size_t, base64_charset)Here is the source code of the function being tested:unsigned char* buffer_append_base64_decode(buffer *out, const char* in, size_t in_length, base64_charset charset) {    const size_t reserve = 3*(in_length/4) + 3;    unsigned char * const result = (unsigned char *)      buffer_string_prepare_append(out, reserve);    const size_t out_pos =      li_base64_dec(result, reserve, in, in_length, charset);    buffer_commit(out, out_pos);    return (out_pos || !in_length) ? result : NULL;}Here is the source code for functions which reference the function being tested:…  2. Fixing any compilation issues that arise. Once a developer has a candidate target, they would try to compile it and look at any compilation issues that arise. Again, we can prompt an LLM with details of the compilation errors so it can provide fixes.  Prompt: Below is the error to fix:The code has the following build issues:server_fuzzer.cc:12:46: error: only virtual member functions can be marked 'override'   12 |   bool OnData(const char* data, size_t size) override {      |                                              ^~~~~~~~server_fuzzer.cc:22:39: error: no type named 'MultiPartFile' in namespace 'httplib'   22 |                        const httplib::MultiPartFile& file) override {      |                              ~~~~~~~~~^server_fuzzer.cc:12:27: warning: unused parameter 'data' [-Wunused-parameter]   12 |   bool OnData(const char* data, size_t size) override {      |                           ^server_fuzzer.cc:37:5: error: use of undeclared 'operator()'   37 |     operator()(request_data.data(), receiver);      |     ^server_fuzzer.cc:27:23: warning: private field 'provider_' is not used [-Wunused-private-field]   27 |   FuzzedDataProvider& provider_;      |                       ^Example of compilation errors that an LLM was able to fix3. Running the fuzz target to see how it performs, and fixing any obvious mistakes causing runtime issues.Once all compilation errors are fixed, a developer would try running the fuzz target for a short period of time to see if there were any mistakes that led it to instantly crash, suggesting an error with the target rather than a bug discovered in the project.The following is an example of an LLM fixing a semantic issue with the fuzzing setup: LLM Response:The issue is that `sqlite3_blob_open` requires the table to exist before you can open a blob on it. The fix ensures that the table exists by executing a `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` statement before calling `sqlite3_blob_open`. Here's a breakdown of the changes:1. **Create Table Query:** A string `createTableQuery` is constructed to hold the SQL statement for creating the table. It uses the fuzzed values for the table and column names.2. **Prepare Statement:** `sqlite3_prepare_v2` is used to prepare the SQL statement from `createTableQuery`. This compiles the SQL into a byte-code program that SQLite can execute.3. **Execute Statement:** `sqlite3_step` executes the prepared statement. Since it's a `CREATE TABLE` statement, it doesn't return any data, but it creates the table if it doesn't exist.4. **Finalize Statement:** `sqlite3_finalize` destroys the prepared statement object when it's no longer needed.By adding these steps before calling `sqlite3_blob_open`, we ensure that the table exists, preventing the null pointer access issue. 4. Running the corrected fuzz target for a longer period of time, and triaging any crashes.At this point, the fuzz target is ready to run for an extended period of time on a suitable fuzzing infrastructure, such as ClusterFuzz. Any discovered crashes would then need to be triaged, to determine the root causes and whether they represented legitimate vulnerabilities (or bugs in the fuzz target). An LLM can be prompted with the relevant context (stacktraces, fuzz target source code, relevant project source code) to perform this triage. Prompt: Given the following crash report, fuzz driver code and relevant project function code, analyze the cause of the crash.First, only answer “Crash is caused by bug in fuzz driver” or “Crash is caused by bug in project”. Second, offer a succinct and to-the-point analysis.Below is crash report:AddressSanitizer: heap-use-after-free on address 0x502000000630 at pc 0x560036939242 bp 0x7ffd65dca850 sp 0x7ffd65dca010READ of size 1 at 0x502000000630 thread T0SCARINESS: 40 (1-byte-read-heap-use-after-free)    #0 0x560036939241 in __asan_memcpy /src/llvm-project/compiler-rt/lib/asan/asan_interceptors_memintrinsics.cpp:63:3    #1 0x56003697d30b in EmitLiteral /src/snappy/snappy.cc:661:5    #2 0x56003697d30b in snappy::internal::CompressFragment(char const*, unsigned long, char*, unsigned short*, int) /src/snappy/snappy.cc:954:10In this example, the LLM correctly determines this is a bug in the fuzz target, rather than a bug in the project being fuzzed. LLM Response: Crash is caused by bug in fuzz driver.The fuzz driver creates a vector of `iovec` structures, each pointing to a chunk of memory owned by the `FuzzedDataProvider`. However, the `data_chunk` vector, which holds the actual data pointed to by `iov_base`, is deallocated at the end of each fuzzer iteration when it goes out of scope. This leaves the `iov_base` pointers dangling. When `snappy::CompressFromIOVec` tries to access the memory pointed to by these dangling pointers, a heap-use-after-free occurs. 5. Fixing vulnerabilities. The goal is to fully automate this entire workflow by having the LLM generate a suggested patch for the vulnerability. We don’t have anything we can share here today, but we’re collaborating with various researchers to make this a reality and look forward to sharing results soon. Up nextImproving automated triaging: to get to a point where we’re confident about not requiring human review. This will help automatically report new vulnerabilities to project maintainers. There are likely more than the 26 vulnerabilities we’ve already reported upstream hiding in our results.Agent-based architecture: which means letting the LLM autonomously plan out the steps to solve a particular problem by providing it with access to tools that enable it to get more information, as well as to check and validate results. By providing LLM with interactive access to real tools such as debuggers, we’ve found that the LLM is more likely to arrive at a correct result.Integrating our research into OSS-Fuzz as a feature: to achieve a more fully automated end-to-end solution for vulnerability discovery and patching. We hope OSS-Fuzz will be useful for other researchers to evaluate AI-powered vulnerability discovery ideas and ultimately become a tool that will enable defenders to find more vulnerabilities before they get exploited. For more information, check out our open source framework at oss-fuzz-gen. We’re hoping to continue to collaborate on this area with other researchers. Also, be sure to check out the OSS-Fuzz blog for more technical updates.",

      "link": "http://security.googleblog.com/2024/11/retrofitting-spatial-safety-to-hundreds.html",
      "contentSnippet": "Posted by Alex Rebert and Max Shavrick, Security Foundations, and Kinuko Yasuda, Core Developer\n\n\n\n\nAttackers regularly exploit spatial memory safety vulnerabilities, which occur when code accesses a memory allocation outside of its intended bounds, to compromise systems and sensitive data. These vulnerabilities represent a major security risk to users. \n\n\n\nBased on an analysis of in-the-wild exploits tracked by Google's Project Zero, spatial safety vulnerabilities represent 40% of in-the-wild memory safety exploits over the past decade:\n\n\n\n\nBreakdown of memory safety CVEs exploited in the wild by vulnerability class.1\n\nGoogle is taking a comprehensive approach to memory safety. A key element of our strategy focuses on Safe Coding and using memory-safe languages in new code. This leads to an exponential decline in memory safety vulnerabilities and quickly improves the overall security posture of a codebase, as demonstrated by our post about Android's journey to memory safety.\n\n\nHowever, this transition will take multiple years as we adapt our development practices and infrastructure. Ensuring the safety of our billions of users therefore requires us to go further: we're also retrofitting secure-by-design principles to our existing C++ codebase wherever possible.\n\nTo that end, we're working towards bringing spatial memory safety into as many of our C++ codebases as possible, including Chrome and the monolithic codebase powering our services.\n\nWe’ve begun by enabling hardened libc++, which adds bounds checking to standard C++ data structures, eliminating a significant class of spatial safety bugs. While C++ will not become fully memory-safe, these improvements reduce risk as discussed in more detail in our perspective on memory safety, leading to more reliable and secure software.\n\nThis post explains how we're retrofitting hardened libc++ across our codebases and  showcases the positive impact it's already having, including preventing exploits, reducing crashes, and improving code correctness.\n\nBounds-checked data structures: The foundation for spatial safety\n\nOne of our primary strategies for improving spatial safety in C++ is to implement bounds checking for common data structures, starting with hardening the C++ standard library (in our case, LLVM’s libc++). Hardened libc++, recently added by open source contributors, introduces a set of security checks designed to catch vulnerabilities such as out-of-bounds accesses in production.\n\nFor example, hardened libc++ ensures that every access to an element of a std::vector stays within its allocated bounds, preventing attempts to read or write beyond the valid memory region. Similarly, hardened libc++ checks that a std::optional isn't empty before allowing access, preventing access to uninitialized memory.\n\nThis approach mirrors what's already standard practice in many modern programming languages like Java, Python, Go, and Rust. They all incorporate bounds checking by default, recognizing its crucial role in preventing memory errors. C++ has been a notable exception, but efforts like hardened libc++ aim to close this gap in our infrastructure. It’s also worth noting that similar hardening is available in other C++ standard libraries, such as libstdc++.\n\nRaising the security baseline across the board\n\nBuilding on the successful deployment of hardened libc++ in Chrome in 2022, we've now made it default across our server-side production systems. This improves spatial memory safety across our services, including key performance-critical components of products like Search, Gmail, Drive, YouTube, and Maps. While a very small number of components remain opted out, we're actively working to reduce this and raise the bar for security across the board, even in applications with lower exploitation risk.\n\nThe performance impact of these changes was surprisingly low, despite Google's modern C++ codebase making heavy use of libc++. Hardening libc++ resulted in an average 0.30% performance impact across our services (yes, only a third of a percent).\n \nThis is due to both the compiler's ability to eliminate redundant checks during optimization, and the efficient design of hardened libc++. While a handful of performance-critical code paths still require targeted use of explicitly unsafe accesses, these instances are carefully reviewed for safety. Techniques like profile-guided optimizations further improved performance, but even without those advanced techniques, the overhead of bounds checking remains minimal.\n \nWe actively monitor the performance impact of these checks and work to minimize any unnecessary overhead. For instance, we identified and fixed an unnecessary check, which led to a 15% reduction in overhead (reduced from 0.35% to 0.3%), and contributed the fix back to the LLVM project to share the benefits with the broader C++ community. \n\nWhile hardened libc++'s overhead is minimal for individual applications in most cases, deploying it at Google's scale required a substantial commitment of computing resources. This investment underscores our dedication to enhancing the safety and security of our products.\n \n From tests to production\n \nEnabling libc++ hardening wasn't a simple flip of a switch. Rather, it required a multi-stage rollout to avoid accidentally disrupting users or creating an outage:\n\n Testing: We first enabled hardened libc++ in our tests over a year ago. This allowed us to identify and fix hundreds of previously undetected bugs in our code and tests.\n Baking: We let the hardened runtime \"bake\" in our testing and pre-production environments, giving developers time to adapt and address any new issues that surfaced. We also conducted extensive performance evaluations, ensuring minimal impact to our users' experience.\n Gradual Production Rollout: We then rolled out hardened libc++ to production over several months, starting with a small set of services and gradually expanding to our entire infrastructure. We closely monitored the rollout, promptly addressing any crashes or performance regressions.\n \n \n Quantifiable impact\n \n In just a few months since enabling hardened libc++ by default, we've already seen benefits.\n\n Preventing exploits: Hardened libc++ has already disrupted an internal red team exercise and would have prevented another one that happened before we enabled hardening, demonstrating its effectiveness in thwarting exploits. The safety checks have uncovered over 1,000 bugs, and would prevent 1,000 to 2,000 new bugs yearly at our current rate of C++ development.\n\n Improved reliability and correctness: The process of identifying and fixing bugs uncovered by hardened libc++ led to a 30% reduction in our baseline segmentation fault rate across production, indicating improved code reliability and quality. Beyond crashes, the checks also caught errors that would have otherwise manifested as unpredictable behavior or data corruption.\n\n \n \n Moving average of segfaults across our fleet over time, before and after enablement.\n \n\n Easier debugging: Hardened libc++ enabled us to identify and fix multiple bugs that had been lurking in our code for more than a decade. The checks transform many difficult-to-diagnose memory corruptions into immediate and easily debuggable errors, saving developers valuable time and effort. \n \n Bridging the gap with memory-safe languages\n\nWhile libc++ hardening provides immediate benefits by adding bounds checking to standard data structures, it's only one piece of the puzzle when it comes to spatial safety.\n\nWe're expanding bounds checking to other libraries and working to migrate our code to Safe Buffers, requiring all accesses to be bounds checked. For spatial safety, both hardened data structures, including their iterators, and Safe Buffers are necessary.\n\nBeyond improving the safety of our C++, we're also focused on making it easier to interoperate with memory-safe languages. Migrating our C++ to Safe Buffers shrinks the gap between the languages, which simplifies interoperability and potentially even an eventual automated translation.\n\n Building a safer C++ ecosystem\n\nHardened libc++ is a practical and effective way to enhance the safety, reliability, and debuggability of C++ code with minimal overhead. Given this, we strongly encourage organizations using C++ to enable their standard library's hardened mode universally by default.\n\nAt Google, enabling hardened libc++ is only the first step in our journey towards a spatially safe C++ codebase. By expanding bounds checking, migrating to Safe Buffers, and actively collaborating with the broader C++ community, we aim to create a future where spatial safety is the norm.\n\n Acknowledgements\n\nWe’d like to thank Emilia Kasper, Chandler Carruth, Duygu Isler, Matthew Riley, and Jeff Vander Stoep for their helpful feedback. We also extend our thanks to the libc++ community for developing the hardening mode that made this work possible.",
